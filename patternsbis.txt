:Noah's-ark The following diagonal puffer consisting of two switch engines. This was found by Charles Corderman in 1971. The name comes from the variety of objects it leaves behind: blocks, blinkers, beehives, loaves, gliders, ships, boats, long boats, beacons and block on tables.

:n-omino Any polyomino with exactly n cells.

:non-destructive read A type of test reaction in memory cell circuitry, where the information in the memory cell is unchanged and can be read again to produce the same result. One simple type of non-destructive read reaction is a signal sent to a permanent switch. Memory cells with destructive read reactions are generally simpler and more commonly used.

:nonfiller = space nonfiller

:non-monotonic A spaceship is said to be non-monotonic if its leading edge falls back in some generations. The first example (shown below) was found by Hartmut Holzwart in August 1992. This is p4 and travels at c/4. In April 1994, Holzwart found examples of p3 spaceships with this property, and this is clearly the smallest possible period. Another non-monotonic spaceship is the weekender.

Charles Corderman may have found this object in 1971 while exhaustively investigating the fate of all the small polyominoes. Records indicate that he found the switch engine while investigating the decominoes (polyominoes having 10 cells). However, there do not appear to be decominoes which result in a clean switch engine. If Corderman was examining polyominoes in order of size, then this smaller predecessor should have been found first in any case.

:non-spark Something that looks like a spark, but isn't. An OWSS produces one of these instead of a belly spark, and is destroyed by it.

:non-standard spaceship Any spaceship other than a glider, LWSS, MWSS or HWSS.

:non-trivial A non-trivial period-N oscillator contains at least one cell that oscillates at the full period. In other words, it is not made up solely of separate oscillators with smaller periods. Usually it includes a spark or other reaction that would not occur if all lower-period subpatterns were separated from each other, but some exceptions are given under trivial. See also omniperiodic.

:novelty generator A pattern that appears to have an unknown fate due to complex feedback loops, for example involving waves of gliders shuttling between perpendicular rakes. Novelty generator patterns fall short of counting as chaotic growth, since the rakes continue to be predictable, and much of their ash generally remains stable.

It has not been proven conclusively that any particular pattern is in fact an infinite novelty generator, since it is always possible that periodicity will spontaneously arise if the simulation is continued far enough. In fact this happens quite regularly. But conversely, it has not been proven that periodicity must spontaneously arise for all such patterns. Bill Gosper, Nick Gotts and others have done extensive experiments along these lines using Golly.

:NW31 One of the most common stable edge shooters. This Herschel-to-glider converter suppresses the junk ordinarily left behind by an evolving Herschel while allowing both the first natural glider and second natural glider to escape on transparent lanes:

:omniperiodic A cellular automaton is said to be omniperiodic if it has oscillators of all periods. It is not known if Life is omniperiodic, although this seems likely. Dave Buckingham's work on Herschel conduits in 1996 (see My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators) left only a short list of unresolved cases, all with periods of 58 or below. The list has been progressively reduced since then. Most recently, period 43 and 53 oscillators were made possible in 2013 by Mike Playle's Snark. As of June 2018, no oscillators are known for periods 19, 23, 38, or 41. If we insist that the oscillator must be non-trivial, then 34 should be added to this list.

Note that if we were to allow infinite oscillators, then all periods are certainly possible, as any period of 14 or more can be obtained using a glider (or LWSS) stream, or an infinitely long 2c/3 wire containing signals with the desired separation.

:one per generation See grow-by-one object.

:p11 bumper (p11) A periodic colour-preserving glider reflector with a minimum repeat time of 44 ticks. Unlike the p5 through p8 cases where Noam Elkies' domino-spark based reflectors are available, no small period-22 colour-changing reflector is known. A stable Snark reflector can be substituted for any bumper. This changes the timing of the output glider, which can be useful for rephasing periodic glider streams.

In practice this reflector is not useful with input streams below period 121, because lower-period bumpers can be used to reflect all smaller multiples of 11 for which the bumper reaction can be made to work.

:p130 shuttle A shuttle found in March 2004 by David Eppstein, which originally needed several period 5 oscillators for support. David Bell found a reaction between two of the shuttles to produce a p130 glider gun. On 18 November 2017 Tanner Jacobi found that the stable sidesnagger can be used to support the shuttle instead, and this is shown here.

:p144 gun A glider gun with true period 144. The first one was found by Bill Gosper in July 1994. For a full description and pattern see factory.

:p14 gun A glider gun which emits a period 14 glider stream. This is the smallest possible period for any stream, so such a gun is of great interest. There is no known true-period p14 glider gun, and finding a small direct example is well beyond current search algorithms' abilities. However, pseudo-period p14 guns have been created by injecting gliders into a higher period glider stream. The first pseudo p14 gun was built by Dieter Leithner in 1995. Smaller pseudo p14 guns have since been constructed, but they are still much too large to show here. The essential mechanism used by them is demonstrated in GIG.

This changes the timing of the output glider, which can be useful for rephasing periodic glider streams.

:p1 megacell (p1 circuitry) A metacell constructed by Adam P. Goucher in 2008, capable of being programmed to emulate any Moore neighborhood rule, including isotropic and anisotropic non-totalistic rules. It fits in a 32768 by 32768 bounding box, with the resulting metacell grid at 45 degrees to the underlying Life grid. Like the OTCA metapixel, it includes a large "pixel" area so that the state of the megacell can easily be seen even at extremely small-scale zoom levels.

:p1 telegraph (p1 circuitry) A variant of Jason Summers' telegraph pattern, constructed in 2010 by Adam P. Goucher using only stable circuitry. A single incoming glider produces the entire ten-part composite lightspeed signal that restores the beehive-chain lightspeed wire to its original position. The signal is detected at the other end of the telegraph and converted back into a single output signal. This simplification came at the cost of a much slower transmission speed, one bit per 91080 ticks. In this mechanism, sending the entire ten-part signal constitutes a '1' bit, and not sending the signal means '0'. See also high-bandwidth telegraph.

:p22 gun A true period 22 glider gun constructed by David Eppstein in August 2000, using two interacting copies of a p22 oscillator found earlier the same day by Jason Summers.

All known p30 glider guns are made from two or more interacting queen bee shuttles. Paul Callahan found 30 different ways that three queen bee shuttles can react to form a period 30 glider gun. One of the most interesting of these is shown below in which the gliders emerge in an unexpected direction.

:p44 MWSS gun A gun discovered by Dieter Leithner in April 1997, in a somewhat larger form. This was the smallest known gliderless gun and smallest known MWSS gun until the construction in 2017 of the gun shown under gliderless, based on Tanner's p46.

The p44 MWSS gun is based on a p44 oscillator discovered by Dave Buckingham in early 1992, shown here in an improved form found in January 2005 by Jason Summers using a new p4 sparker by Nicolay Beluchenko. A glider shape appears in this gun for three consecutive generations, but always as part of a larger cluster, so even a purist would regard this gun as gliderless.

:p46 gun A glider gun which has true-period 46. The first one found was the new gun by Bill Gosper in 1971. Prior to the discovery of Tanner's p46 in October 2017, all known p46 guns were made from two or more twin bees shuttles that interact (e.g., see twin bees shuttle pair). See edge shooter and double-barrelled for two more of these.

On 21 October 2017 Heinrich Koenig found a glider gun using two copies of Tanner's p46 placed at right angles to each other. This is the first p46 gun found which makes no use of the twin bees shuttle.

:p4 bumper (p4) A periodic colour-preserving glider reflector with a minimum repeat time of 36. Unlike the p5 through p8 cases where Noam Elkies' domino spark-based reflectors are available, no small period-4 colour-changing reflector is known. A stable Snark reflector can be substituted for any bumper. This changes the timing of the output glider, which can be useful for rephasing periodic glider streams.

:p4 reflector The following glider reflector, discovered by Karel Suhajda in October 2012. Its minimum repeat time is 52 ticks. Unlike the various bouncers discovered many years earlier, it is a colour-preserving reflector, so it was made obsolete the following year by the discovery of the much smaller stable Snark, which uses the same initial bait reaction and so produces an output glider with the same timing. For a smaller periodic colour-preserving glider reflector with a different output timing, see p4 bumper.

There are several other ways to create a p60 gun from two p30 guns using period-doubling reactions similar to the one shown here.
:p690 gun A true period 690 glider gun found by Noam Elkies in July 1996. It is composed of a p30 queen bee shuttle pair and a p46 twin bees shuttle whose sparks occasionally react with each other. This is a very compact gun for such a high period and is used in many patterns requiring sparse glider streams.

:p92 gun A glider gun with a true period of 92. The first one was found by Bill Gosper in 1971 using a period doubling reaction using two p46 guns. Many different p92 guns are known that use multiple twin bees shuttles. A period 92 gun can also be made by adding a semi-cenark to any period 46 glider gun.

On 18 November 2017, Martin Grant found a new gun using one twin bees shuttle and one Tanner's p46 oscillator, making it the smallest known p92 gun.

:parallel grey ship = with-the-grain grey ship

:Parallel HBK ((6,3)c/245912, p245912) A much smaller successor to the half-baked knightship, constructed by Chris Cain in September 2014. Several slow-salvo recipes are needed to support the multi-glider salvo seeds at the upstream end of the spaceship. "Parallel" means that these recipes are sent in parallel instead of one after the other, in series, as in the original HBK.

:Parallel HBK gun An armless constructor pattern that is programmed to build Parallel HBK oblique spaceships every 125906944 ticks. This gun was created by Chris Cain on 3 January 2015.

:parasite A self-sustaining reaction attached to the output of a rake or puffer, that damages or modifies the standard output. Compare tagalong. In 2009, while experimenting with novelty generator patterns in Golly, Mitchell Riley discovered parasites on glider streams from p20 and p8 backward rakes. In some cases, parasites can even "reproduce", as in the pattern below, though the number of copies is limited since they will eventually use up their host glider stream:

:parent A pattern is said to be a parent of the pattern it gives rise to after one generation. Some patterns have infinitely many parents, but others have none at all (see Garden of Eden). Typically parents are considered trivial if they contain groups of cells that can be removed without changing the result, such as isolated faraway cells.

:parent cells The three cells that cause a new cell to be born.

:parity Even or odd, particularly as applied to the phase of an oscillator or spaceship. For example, in slow salvo constructions, the intermediate targets are frequently period 2, most often because they contain blinkers or traffic lights. A glider striking a P2 constellation will generally produce a different result depending on its parity. Period-4 intermediate targets are rare (or not used), so it doesn't matter for example whether an odd-parity glider in a slow salvo is phase 1 or phase 3. Only the even/odd parity is important.

:partial result An intermediate object found by a search program which might be a substantial part of a complete spaceship or oscillator, but which isn't complete.

Running a partial result works for a few generations until the speed of light corruption from any unfinished edge destroys the whole object. But a partial result can still be used to see whether the object (if ever finished) would provide a desired spark or perturbation. If no partial results are found then it is likely that no such object exists under the constraints of the search.

Very large partial results can indicate that there is a good chance that the object being searched for might actually exist (but this is no guarantee). Rerunning the search using the partial result as a base and relaxing some constraints, widening or adjusting the search area, or splitting the object into multiple arms might result in finding a complete working object.

As an example, here is a large partial result for a period 6 knightship found by Josh Ball in April 2017. The first 22 columns were rediscovered in 2018 as part of the successful search for Sir Robin. See also almost knightship for an earlier small example by Eugene Langvagen.

:pentadecathlon (p15) Found in 1970 by Conway while tracking the history of short rows of cells, 10 cells giving this object, which is the most natural oscillator of period greater than 3. In fact it is the fifth most common oscillator overall, appearing in random soups slightly more frequently than the clock, but much less frequently than the blinker, toad, beacon or pulsar. The pentadecathlon can be constructed using just three gliders, as shown in glider synthesis.

The pentadecathlon is the only known oscillator that has two phases that are different polyominoes. It produces accessible V sparks and domino sparks, which give it a great capacity for doing perturbations, especially for period 30 based technology. See relay for example.

:pentomino Any 5-cell polyomino. There are 12 such patterns, and Conway assigned them all letters in the range O to Z, loosely based on their shapes. Only in the case of the R-pentomino has Conway's label remained in common use, but all of them can nonetheless be found in this lexicon.

:period The smallest number of generations it takes for an oscillator or spaceship to reappear in its original form. The term can also be used for a puffer, wick, fuse, superstring, stream of spaceships, factory or gun. In the last case there is a distinction between true period and pseudo period. There is also a somewhat different concept of period for wicktrailers.

:period doubler See period multiplier.

:periodic For circuit mechanisms, "periodic" is the opposite of p1 or stable. Periodic circuits necessarily contain oscillators, and therefore they can generally only accept input signals that are synchronized to the combined period of those oscillators (but see universal regulator).

For signal streams, "periodic" means that signals will only be present in the stream at one out of every n ticks, where n is the period of the stream. In a periodic intermittent stream there may be gaps, so that signals do not always appear at every nth tick. However, if a signal does appear, its distance measured in ticks from previous and future signals will always be an exact multiple of n.

:period multiplier A term commonly used for a pulse divider, because dividing the number of signals in a regular stream by N necessarily multiplies the period by N. The term "period multiplier" can be somewhat misleading in this context, because most such circuits can accept input streams that are not strictly periodic.

Reactions have also been found to period double or period triple the output of some rakes to create high-period rakes in a relatively small space (i.e., an exponential increase in period for a linear increase in size).

For Herschel signals and glider guns, a number of small period doubler, tripler, and quadrupler mechanisms are known. For example, the following conduit produces one output glider after accepting four input B-heptominoes, or four Herschels if a conduit such as F117 is prepended that includes the same BFx59H converter.

See semi-Snark and tremi-Snark for additional examples using glider streams. As of June 2018 no stable period-multiplying elementary conduits are known for a multiplication factor of five or higher, though it is easy to construct composite ones.

:permanent switch A signal-carrying circuit that can be modified so that it cleanly absorbs any future signals instead of allowing them to pass. Optionally there may be a separate mechanism to restore the circuit to its original function.

In the following example, a glider from the northeast (shown) will perform a simple block pull that switches off an F166 conduit, so that any future Herschel inputs will be cleanly absorbed. A glider from the southwest (also shown) can restore the block to its original position.

:perpendicular grey ship = against-the-grain grey ship

:perturb To change the fate of an object by reacting it with other objects. Typically, the other objects are sparks from spaceships or oscillators, or are eaters or impacting spaceships. Perturbations are typically done to turn a dirty reaction into a clean one, or to change the products of a reaction. In many desirable cases the perturbing objects are not destroyed by the reaction, or else are easily replenished.

:perturbation = perturb.

:PF35W One of the three elementary conduits used in the composite Fx176 Herschel conduit. It converts an input pi-heptomino into an output wing in 35 ticks. In November 2017, Aidan F. Pierce discovered the compact PF35W variant below, which improved the repeat time of the Fx176 to 73 ticks and allowed gliders from following dependent conduits to escape freely:

:phase A representative generation of a periodic object such as an oscillator or spaceship. The number of phases is equal to the period of the object. The phases of an object usually repeat in the same cyclic sequence forever, although some perturbations can cause a phase change.

:phase change A perturbation of a periodic object that causes the object to skip forward or backward by one or more phases. If the perturbation is repeated indefinitely, this can effectively change the period of the object. An example of this, found by Dean Hickerson in November 1998, is shown below. In this example, the period of the oscillator would be 7 if the mold were removed, but the period is increased to 8 because of the repeated phase changes caused by the mold's spark.

The following pattern demonstrates a p4 c/2 spaceship found by Jason Summers, in which the phase is changed as it deletes a forward glider. This phase change allows the spaceship to be used to delete a glider wave produced by a rake whose period is 2 (mod 4).

Phase changing reactions have enabled the construction of spaceships having periods that were otherwise unknown, and also allow the construction of period-doubling and period-tripling convoys to easily produce very high period rakes.

One oscillator which produces this spark is Tanner's p46. The pentadecathlon produces a slightly corrupted version of this spark.

:phoenix Any pattern all of whose cells die in every generation, but which never dies as a whole. A spaceship cannot be a phoenix, and in fact every finite phoenix eventually evolves into an oscillator. The following 12-cell oscillator (found by the MIT group in December 1971) is the smallest known phoenix, and is sometimes called simply "the phoenix".

Every known phoenix oscillator has period 2. In January 2000, Stephen Silver showed that a period 3 oscillator cannot be a phoenix. The situation for higher periods is unknown.
An easy synthesis of the phoenix is possible using four blocks as seeds. A puffer creating a growing row of phoenixes has the unusual property that the percentage of live cells that stay alive for more than one generation approaches zero. See lone dot agar for an example of an infinite phoenix.

:pi = pi-heptomino

:Pianola breeder A series of patterns by Paul Tooke in 2010, based on a simplification and extension of the Gemini spaceship's construction mechanism. Tooke produced a number of slow-salvo-constructed patterns with superlinear growth, including a series of breeder patterns of previously unknown types. For some patterns, the Gemini's two construction arms were moved to a permanent stationary platform, using fourteen glider-loop channels instead of twelve.

Some of these breeder patterns remain difficult to classify unambiguously. For example, one pattern was designed to be an MSS breeder - a modified Gemini spaceship puffing slide guns which build lines of blocks. However, the slide guns produce both moving and stationary objects at a linear rate, because streams of gliders are needed to reach out to the construction zone to do the push reaction and build more blocks. The pattern could therefore be classified as a hybrid MSM/MSS breeder. Other breeder patterns utilizing slide guns and universal constructor technology are likely to cause similar classification ambiguities.

:pi calculator (p1 circuitry) A device constructed by Adam P. Goucher in February 2010, which calculates the decimal digits of pi (the transcendental number, not the Life pattern!) and displays them in the Life universe as 8Ã—10 dot matrix characters formed by arrangements of blocks along a diagonal stripe at the top. A push reaction moves a ten-block diagonal cursor to the next position as part of the "printing" operation for each new digit.

The actual calculation is done in binary, using a streaming spigot algorithm based on linear fractional transformations. The pi calculator is made up of a 188-state computer connected to a printing device via period-8 regulators and a binary-to-decimal conversion mechanism. The complete pattern can be found in Golly's Very Large Patterns online archive, along with the very similar 177-state phi calculator which uses a simpler algorithm to calculate and print the Golden Ratio.

:pi climber The reaction that defines rate of travel of the Caterpillar spaceship. A pi climber consists of a pi-heptomino "climbing" a chain of blinkers, moving 17 cells every 45 ticks, and leaving behind an identical chain of blinkers, shifted downward by 6 cells. A single pi climber does not produce any gliders or other output, but two or more of them travelling on nearby blinker chains can be arranged to emit gliders every 45 ticks. Compare Herschel-pair climber.

:pixel = cell

:plet = polyplet

:polyomino A finite collection of orthogonally connected cells. The mathematical study of polyominoes was initiated by Solomon Golomb in 1953. Conway's early investigations of Life and other cellular automata involved tracking the histories of small polyominoes, this being a reasonable way to ascertain the typical behaviour of different cellular automata when the patterns had to be evolved by hand rather than by computer. Polyominoes have no special significance in Life, but their extensive study during the early years lead to a number of important discoveries and has influenced the terminology of Life. (Note on spelling: As with "dominoes" the plural may also be spelt without an e. In this lexicon I have followed Golomb in using the longer form.)

It is possible for a polyomino to be an oscillator. In fact there are infinitely many examples of such polyominoes, namely the cross and its larger analogues. The only other known examples are the block, the blinker, the toad, the star and (in two different phases) the pentadecathlon.

A polyomino can also be a spaceship, as the LWSS, MWSS and HWSS show.

:polyplet A finite collection of orthogonally or diagonally connected cells. This king-wise connectivity is a more natural concept in Life than the orthogonal connectivity of the polyomino.

:PPS (c/5 orthogonally, p30) A pre-pulsar spaceship. Any of three different p30 c/5 orthogonal spaceships in which a pre-pulsar is pushed by a pair of spiders. The back sparks of the spaceship can be used to perturb gliders in many different ways, allowing the easy construction of c/5 puffers. The first PPS was found by David Bell in May 1998 based on a p15 pre-pulsar spaceship found by Noam Elkies in December 1997. See also SPPS and APPS.

The pattern below shows the basic mechanism of a PPS. The two isolated sparks at the left and right sides are the edge sparks from the two supporting spiders.

	OOO...OOO
A pair of tubs can be placed to eat half the pre-pulsar as it replicates; this gives the p30 oscillator Eureka where the pre-pulsar's replication becomes a movement back and forth. See twirling T-tetsons II for a variation on this idea. By other means the replication of the pre-pulsar can be made to occur in just 14 generations as half of it is eaten; this allows the construction of p28 and p29 oscillators. The pre-pulsar was also a vital component of the first known p26 and p47 oscillators.

:pseudo Opposite of true. A gun emitting a period n stream of spaceships (or rakes) is said to be a pseudo period n gun if its mechanism oscillates with a period greater than n. This period will necessarily be a multiple of n. If the base mechanism's period is instead a fraction of n, then a period multiplier must also be present which is considered to be part of the mechanism, and the gun as a whole is still a true period gun. For example, a filter may be used on a lower-period gun to produce a compound gun such as the true p48 gun.

Pseudo period n glider guns are known to exist for all periods greater than or equal to 14, with smaller periods being impossible. All known p14 guns are pseudo guns requiring several signal injections, so they are quite large. The following smaller example is a pseudo period 123 gun, interleaving the streams from two true period 246 guns:

:pseudo-random glider generator A pseudo-random number generator in which the bits are represented by the presence or absence of gliders. The first pseudo-random glider generator was built by Bill Gosper. David Bell built the first moving one in 1997, using c/3 rakes.

:pseudo-random number generator A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is an algorithm that produces a sequence of bits that looks random (but cannot really be random, being algorithmically determined).

In Life, the term refers to a PRNG implemented as a Life pattern, with the bits represented by the presence or absence of objects such as gliders or blocks. Such a PRNG usually contains gliders or other spaceships in a loop with a feedback mechanism that causes later spaceships to interfere with the generation of earlier spaceships. The period can be very high, as a loop of n spaceships has 2n possible states.

:pseudo still life A stable pattern whose live cells are either immediately adjacent to each other, or are connected into a single group by adjacent dead cells where birth is suppressed by overpopulation.

The definition of strict still life rules out such stable patterns as the bi-block. In such patterns there are dead cells which have more than 3 neighbours in total, but fewer than 3 in any component still life. These patterns are called pseudo still lifes, and have been enumerated up to 32 bits, as shown in the table below.

	--------------
	Bits    Number

	32  6123084116
	--------------
Attribution of these counts is given in strict still life; see also https://oeis.org/A056613. The unique 32-bit triple pseudo still life is included in the last count in the table. As the number of bits increases, the pseudo still life count goes up exponentially by approximately O(2.56n). By comparison, the rate for strict still lifes is about O(2.46n) while for quasi still lifes it's around O(3.04n).

If a stable pattern's live cells plus its overpopulated dead cells do not form a single mutually adjacent group, the pattern is usually referred to as a constellation. It is also a still life in the general sense, but is neither "pseudo" nor "strict".

Discounting wickstretchers, which are not puffers in the conventional sense, no new velocity was obtained after this until David Bell found the first c/3 orthogonal puffer in April 1996. Other new puffer speeds followed over the next several years.

Many spaceships that travel orthogonally at a speed less than c/2 have useful side or back sparks. These can be used to perturb standard spaceships that approach from behind. A common technique for creating puffers for a new speed uses a convoy of the new spaceships to create debris from an approaching standard spaceship such that a new standard spaceship is recreated on the same path as the original one. This forms a closed loop, resulting in a high-period puffer for the new speed.

As of June 2018, puffers have been found matching every known velocity of elementary spaceship, except for c/6 and c/7 diagonal and (2,1)c/6. It is also generally easy to create puffers based on macro-spaceships, simply by removing some part of the trailing cleanup mechanism.

:puffer engine A pattern which can be used as the main component of a puffer. The pattern may itself be a puffer (e.g. the classic puffer train), it may be a spaceship (e.g. the Schick engine), or it may even be unstable (e.g. the switch engine).

:pufferfish (c/2, p12) A puffer discovered by Richard Schank in November 2014, from a symmetric soup search using an early version of apgsearch. It consists of a pair of B-heptominoes stabilised by a backend that leaves only pairs of blocks behind. It is simple enough to be easily synthesized with gliders.

See soup for a random initial pattern, generated by apgsearch and recorded in Catagolue, that produces a pufferfish.
:pufferfish spaceship (c/2, p36) Generally, any spaceship constructed using pufferfish. May refer specifically to the extensible c/2 spaceship constructed by Ivan Fomichev in December 2014, the first such spaceship to contain no period-2 or period-4 parts. (The first two or three rows might be considered to be period 2 or 4, but they are directly dependent on following rows for support.).

The pattern consists of two adjacent pufferfish puffers, plus four copies of a nontrivial period 36 c/2 fuse for pufferfish exhaust, discovered using a randomized soup search.

:puffer train The full name for a puffer, coined by Conway before any examples were known. The term was also applied specifically to the classic puffer train found by Bill Gosper and shown below. This is very dirty, and the tail does not stabilize until generation 5533. It consists of a B-heptomino (shown here one generation before the standard form) escorted by two LWSS. (This was the second known puffer. The first is shown under puffer.)

:puff suppressor An attachment at the back of a line puffer that suppresses all or some of its puffing action. The example below (by Hartmut Holzwart) has a 3-cell puff suppressor at the back which suppresses the entire puff, making a p2 spaceship. If you delete this puff suppressor then you get a p60 double beehive puffer. Puff suppressors were first recognised by Alan Hensel in April 1994.

:pulse A moving object, such as a spaceship or Herschel, which can be used to transmit information. See pulse divider.

Also another name for a pulsar quadrant.

:pulse divider A mechanism that lets every n-th object that reaches it pass through, and deletes all the rest, where n > 1 and the objects are typically gliders, spaceships or Herschels. A common synonym is period multiplier. For n=2, the simplest known stable pulse dividers are the semi-Snarks.

The following diagram shows a p5 glider pulse divider by Dieter Leithner (February 1998). The first glider moves the centre block and is reflected at 90 degrees. The next glider to come along will not be reflected, but will move the block back to its original position. The relatively small size and low period of this example made it useful for constructing compact glider guns of certain periods, but it became largely obsolete with the discovery of the stable CC semi-Snark, which uses the same basic mechanism. Period 7, 22, 36 and 46 versions of this pulse divider are also known.

As a consequence of the Four-Colour Theorem, there can be no analogous objects requiring decomposition into five or more pieces. By convention, patterns like this and the triple pseudo are considered to be pseudo still lifes, not strict still lifes. As of June 2018, it has been shown that no quad pseudo patterns exist with 32 or fewer bits, but a 33-bit pattern with this property may theoretically still be found.

:quadratic filter A toolkit developed by Dean Hickerson and Gabriel Nivasch in 2006, enabling the construction of patterns with asymptotic population growth matching an infinite number of different sublinear functions - namely, O(t(1/2n)) for any chosen n. See also exponential filter, recursive filter.

:quadratic growth The fastest possible asymptotic rate of population growth for any Life pattern - O(t2) in big-O notation, where t is the number of ticks. The first quadratic-growth pattern found was Bill Gosper's 1971 breeder. Many other types of breeders and spacefillers have been constructed since.

In April 2011, Stephen Silver gave an example of a one-cell-thick pattern over a million cells long that exhibited quadratic growth. In October 2015, Chris Cain constructed a one-cell-thick pattern with a reduced bounding box of 2596Ã—1, improving on a series of previous longer results. The smallest known quadratic growth pattern by initial population is the 23-cell switch-engine ping-pong by Michael Simkin.

There are an infinite number of possible growth rates between linear and quadratic growth. See superlinear growth.

:quadratic replicator A pattern that fills all or part of the Life plane by making copies of itself in a nonlinear way. Small quadratic replicators are known in other Life-like rules, but as of July 2018 no example has been found or constructed in Conway's Life.

:quadratic sawtooth Any sawtooth pattern with a quadratic envelope, or specifically a pattern assembled by Martin Grant in May 2015, consisting of two caber tossers with period multipliers for timing which activate and deactivate two toggleable rake guns (see toggleable gun). The gliders emitted by those rakes annihilate on the diagonal while the rakes are eaten by 2c/5 ships. All the rakes and gliders are destroyed before the next cycle. See also Osqrtlogt.

:quadri-Snark A period-multiplying colour-preserving signal conduit found by Tanner Jacobi in October 2017, producing one output glider for every four input gliders. It is made by replacing one of the eaters in a tremi-Snark with a catalyst found using Bellman. The catalyst causes the formation of a tub which then requires an additional glider to delete. However, this adds 5 ticks to the repeat time, so that it becomes 48. If period quadrupling is needed with a colour-changing reaction, a CP semi-Snark and a CC semi-Snark can be used in series, or a period-multiplying Herschel conduit can be connected to a syringe and an appropriately chosen Herschel-to-glider converter.

:quarter diagonal A unit of measurement sometimes used for diagonal distances, especially for slow salvo glider lanes. One advantage of measurement in quarter diagonals is that gliders travel diagonally at 1qd/tick, so that the same integer value can serve as either a time or a diagonal distance measurement.

:quasi still life A stable constellation where the individual still lifes share dead cells, so the neighborhoods of those dead cells are changed, but all cells that used to remain dead from under-population still do so. Under Life rules, this occurs when objects are diagonally adjacent (e.g., two blocks sharing a single diagonal neighbor) or when single protruding cells in two objects such as tubs share multiple neighbors. The term is due to Mark Niemiec.

:queen bee See queen bee shuttle.

:queen bee shuttle (p30) Found by Bill Gosper in 1970. There are a number of ways to stabilize the ends. Gosper originally stabilized shuttles against one another in a square of eight shuttles. Two simpler methods are shown here; for a third see buckaroo. The queen bee shuttle is the basis of all known true p30 guns (see Gosper glider gun).

:queen bee shuttle pair Any arrangement of two queen bee shuttles such that the two beehives created between them are consumed in some way. There are many ways that the two shuttles can be placed, either head-to-head, or else at right angles. The most well-known and useful arrangement results in the Gosper glider gun.

Other arrangements don't create any lasting output, but create large sparks which can perturb objects (especially gliders) in various ways. For example, one arrangement of a queen bee shuttle pair was used in the original unit Life cell as a memory cell. Here an input glider is converted into a block, which remains until it is deleted by a glider on a right-angled path.

:R190 A composite conduit, one of the original sixteen Herschel conduits, discovered by Dave Buckingham in July 1996. It is made up of two elementary conduits, HRx131B + BFx59H. After 190 ticks, it produces a Herschel turned 90 degrees clockwise at (24, 16) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 107 ticks. A ghost Herschel in the pattern below marks the output location:

:r5 = R-pentomino

:R64 An elementary conduit, one of the original sixteen Herschel conduits, discovered by Dave Buckingham in September 1995. After 64 ticks, it produces a Herschel rotated 90 degrees clockwise at (11, 9) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 153 ticks, though this can be improved to 61 ticks by adding a from-the-side eater inside the turn to avoid interference from the output Herschel's first natural glider, as shown below. A ghost Herschel in the pattern below marks the output location:

:racetrack A pattern in which a signal makes its way in a loop through an "obstacle course" of reactions in order to demonstrate various ways that the signal can be reflected, temporarily stored, and converted. The more different reactions that are used the better the racetrack. David Goodenough built racetracks for p30 and p46 technology in 1995. Racetracks are also known for Herschel conduit technology, and simple ones are useful for building oscillators and glider guns.

:rake Any puffer whose debris consists of spaceships. A rake is said to be forwards, backwards or sideways according to the direction of the spaceships relative to the direction of the rake. Originally the term "rake" was applied only to forwards c/2 glider puffers (see space rake). Many people prefer not to use the term in the case where the puffed spaceships travel parallel or anti-parallel to the puffer, as in this case they do not rake out any significant region of the Life plane (and, in contrast to true rakes, these puffers cannot travel in a stream, and so could never be produced by a gun).

Although the first rakes (circa 1971) were c/2, rakes of other velocities have since been built. Dean Hickerson's construction of Corderships in 1991 made it easy for c/12 diagonal rakes to be built, although no one actually did this until 1998, by which time David Bell had constructed c/3 and c/5 rakes (May 1996 and September 1997, respectively). Jason Summers constructed a 2c/5 rake in June 2000 (building on work by Paul Tooke and David Bell) and a c/4 orthogonal rake in October 2000 (based largely on reactions found by David Bell).

The smallest possible period for a rake is probably 7, as this could be achieved by a 3c/7 orthogonal backwards glider puffer. The smallest period attained to date is 8 (Jason Summers' backrake, March 2001).

:R-bee = bun. This name is due to the fact that the pattern is a single-cell modification of a beehive.

:reaction envelope The collection of cells that are alive during some part of a given active reaction. This term is used for Herschel circuits and other stable circuitry, whereas construction envelope is specific to recipes in self-constructing circuitry.

There are some subtleties at the edges of the envelope. Specifically, two reactions that have the exact same set of cells defining their envelopes may have different behavior when placed next to a single-cell protrusion like the tail of an eater1, or one side of a tub. The difference depends on whether two orthogonally adjacent cells at the edge of the envelope are ever simultaneously alive, within the protruding cell's zone of influence.

:reanimation A reaction performed by a convoy of spaceships (or other moving objects) which converts a common stationary object into a glider without harming the convoy. This provides one way for signals that have been frozen in place by some previous reaction to be released for use.

Simple reactions using period 4 c/2 spaceships have been found for reanimating a block, boat, beehive, ship, loaf, bi-block, or toad. The most interesting of these is for a beehive since it seems to require an unusual p4 spaceship:

Reanimation of a loaf is used many times in the Caterloopillar. It is also used in the Caterpillar as part of its catch and throw mechanism. Finally, reanimation can produce rakes from some puffers. See stop and restart for a similar idea that applies to Herschel conduits and other signal circuitry.

There are small objects which have no known reanimation reactions using c/2 ships other than the brute force method of hitting them with the output of rakes.

:reburnable fuse A very rare type of fuse whose output is identical to its input, possibly with some spatial and/or temporal offset. See lightspeed wire for an example. Reburnable fuses are used primarily in the construction of fixed-speed self-supporting macro-spaceships, where the speed of the fuse's burning reaction becomes the speed of the spaceship. Examples include the Caterpillar, Centipede, and waterbear.

:receiver See Herschel receiver.

:recipe = glider synthesis or construction recipe.

:recovery time The number of ticks that must elapse after a signal is sent through a conduit, before another signal can be safely sent on the same path. In general, a lower recovery time means a more useful conduit. For example, the Snark's very low recovery time allowed for the creation of oscillators with previously unknown periods, 43 and 53.

For the most part this is a synonym for repeat time. However, overclocking a complex circuit can often allow it to be used at a repeat time much lower than its safe recovery time.

:rectifier The smallest known 180-degree reflector, discovered by Adam P. Goucher in 2009. It was the smallest and fastest stable reflector of any kind until the discovery of the Snark in 2013. The rectifier has the same output glider as the boojum reflector but a much shorter repeat time of only 106 ticks.

Another advantage of the rectifier is that the output glider is on a transparent lane, so it can be used in logic circuitry to merge two signal paths.

:recursive filter A toolkit developed by Alexey Nigin in July 2015, which enables the construction of patterns with population growth that asymptotically matches an infinite number of different superlinear functions. Toolkits enabling other, sublinear infinite series had been completed by Dean Hickerson and Gabriel Nivasch in 2006. See quadratic filter and exponential filter.

Sublinear functions are possible using the recursive-filter toolkit as well. It can be used to construct a glider-emitting pattern with a slowness rate S(t) = O(log***...*(t)), the nth-level iterated logarithm of t, which asymptotically dominates any primitive-recursive function f(t).

:reflector Any stable or oscillating pattern that can reflect some type of spaceship (usually a glider) without suffering permanent damage. A pattern that is damaged or destroyed during the reflection process is generally called a one-time turner instead.

The first known reflector was the pentadecathlon, which functions as a 180-degree glider reflector (see relay). Other examples include the buckaroo, the twin bees shuttle and some oscillators based on the traffic jam reaction. Glider guns can also be made into reflectors, although these are mostly rather large.

In September 1998 Noam Elkies found some fast small-period glider reflectors, with oscillators supplying the required domino sparks at different periods. A figure-8 produced a p8 bouncer, and a p6 pipsquirter produced an equivalent p6 bouncer. A more complicated construction allows a p5 bouncer (which, as had been anticipated, soon led to a true p55 Quetzal gun). And in August 1999 Elkies found a suitable sparker to produce a p7 bouncer, allowing the first p49 oscillator to be constructed.

These were all called simply "p5 reflector", "p6 reflector", etc., until 6 April 2016 when Tanner Jacobi discovered an equally small and simple reaction, the bumper, starting with a loaf as bait instead of a boat. This resulted in a series of periodic colour-preserving reflectors, whereas Elkies' bouncer reflectors are all colour-changing. A useful mnemonic is that "bouncer" contains a C and is colour-changing, whereas "bumper" contains a P and is colour-preserving.

Stable reflectors are special in that if they satisfy certain conditions they can be used to construct oscillators of all sufficiently large periods. It was known for some time that stable reflectors were possible (see universal constructor), but no one was able to construct an explicit example until Paul Callahan did so in October 1996.

Callahan's original reflector has a repeat time of 4840, soon improved to 1686, then 894, and then 850. In November 1996 Dean Hickerson found a variant in which this is reduced to 747. Dave Buckingham reduced it to 672 in May 1997 using a somewhat different method, and in October 1997 Stephen Silver reduced it to 623 by a method closer to the original. In November 1998 Callahan reduced this to 575 with a new initial reaction. A small modification by Silver a few days later brought this down to 497.

In April 2001 Dave Greene found a 180-degree stable reflector with a repeat time of only 202 (see boojum reflector). This reflector won bounties offered by Dieter Leithner and Alan Hensel. Half of the prize money was recycled into a new prize for a small 90-degree reflector, which in turn was won by Mike Playle's colour-preserving Snark reflector. The Snark is currently the smallest known stable reflector, with a recovery time of 43. Playle has offered a $100 prize for a colour-changing stable reflector contained within a 25 by 25 bounding box, with a recovery time of 50 generations or less.

As of June 2018, the following splitter is among the smallest known 90-degree colour-changing reflectors. The top output can be blocked off by an eater if needed. For small 180-degree colour-changing reflectors see rectifier, and also the sample pattern in splitter.

:reflectorless rotating oscillator A pattern that rotates itself 90 or 180 degrees after some number of generations, with the additional constraint that multiple non-interacting copies of the pattern can be combined into a new oscillator with a period equal to the appropriate fraction of the component oscillators' period. The second constraint disqualifies small time-symmetric oscillators such as the blinker and monogram.

A working RRO might look something like a pi orbital or p256 gun loop containing one or more pis or Herschels in the same loop, but without any external stabilisation mechanism. Such patterns can be proven to exist (see universal constructor), but as of June 2018 none have been explicitly constructed in Life. There is no upper limit on multiplicity for a constructor-based RRO.

:regulator An object which converts input gliders aligned to some period to output gliders aligned to a different period. The most interesting case is a universal regulator, of which several have been constructed by Paul Chapman and others.

:relay Any oscillator in which spaceships (typically gliders) travel in a loop. The simplest example is the p60 one shown below using two pentadecathlons. Pulling the pentadecathlons further apart allows any period of the form 60+120n to be achieved. This is the simplest proof of the existence of oscillators of arbitrarily large period.

:repeater Any oscillator or spaceship.

:repeat time The minimum number of generations that is possible between the arrival of one object and the arrival of the next. This term is used for things such as reflectors or conduits where the signal objects (gliders or Herschels, for example) will interact fatally with each other if they are too close together, or one will interact fatally with a disturbance caused by the other. For example, the repeat time of Dave Buckingham's 59-step B-heptomino to Herschel conduit (shown under conduit) is 58.

:replicator A finite pattern which repeatedly creates copies of itself. Such objects are known to exist (see universal constructor), but no concrete example is known. The linear propagator may be considered to be the first example of a replicator built in Life, but this is debatable as each of its copies replicates itself only once, allowing no possibility of superlinear growth.

:reverse caber tosser A storage mechanism for data feeding a universal constructor designed by Adam P. Goucher in 2018. A very large integer can be encoded in the position of a very faraway object. If the distance to that object is measured using circuitry designed to be as simple as possible, a complete decoder and universal constructor can be created by colliding a small number of gliders - no more than 329 according to a June 2018 glider synthesis, and exactly 43 according to a July 1 redesign by Chris Cain using eight far-distant GPSEs and, amazingly, no stationary circuitry except for a single catalyst block. Some intermediate designs with 50+ gliders need no stationary circuitry at all.

With the correct placement of the faraway object, the complete pattern is theoretically capable of building any glider-constructible object. This means that 43 is the maximum number of gliders required to build any constructible object, no matter what size. However, it is not possible to determine in practice what the locations of these 43 gliders should be, even for a relatively simple construction.

:rle Run-length encoded. Run-length encoding is a simple (but not very efficient) method of file compression. In Life the term refers to a specific ASCII encoding used for patterns in Conway's Life and other similar cellular automata. This encoding was introduced by Dave Buckingham and is now the usual means of exchanging relatively small patterns by email or in online forum discussions.

As an example of the rle format, here is a representation of the Gosper glider gun. The "run lengths" are the numbers, b's are dead cells, o's are live cells, and dollar signs signal new lines:

	x = 36, y = 9, rule = B3/S23
	24bo$22bobo$12boo6boo12boo$11bo3bo4boo12boo$oo8bo
	5bo3boo$oo8bo3boboo4bobo$10bo5bo7bo$11bo3bo$12boo!
Over the years RLE format has been extended to handle patterns with multiple states, neighborhoods, rules, and universe sizes. A completely different encoding, macrocell format, is used for repetitive patterns that may have very large populations.

:R-mango A small active reaction, so named because it is a single-cell modification of a mango, but now more commonly known as dove.

This converter has several common uses. It can be attached to the L156 Herschel conduit to change it into a useful period doubler. Connecting it to the initial stage of the L156 produces a composite Herschel-to-glider converter often used as a splitter, or as a quasi-edge shooter after suppressing the additional glider output:

The above H-to-2G mechanism appears in many places in the glider gun collection, for example, mainly for periods below 78 where syringes can't be used to build small true-period guns. The insertion reaction allows a glider to be placed 19 ticks in front of another glider on the same lane, or 30 ticks behind it (28 if the perpendicular glider output is suppressed.)
:rock Dean Hickerson's term for an eater which remains intact throughout the eating process. The snake in Dave Buckingham's 59-step B-to-Herschel conduit (shown under conduit) is an example. Other still lifes that sometimes act as rocks include the tub, the hook with tail, the eater1 (eating with its tail) and the hat (in Heinrich Koenig's stabilization of the twin bees shuttle).

:rotor The cells of an oscillator that change state. Compare stator. It is easy to see that any rotor cell must be adjacent to another rotor cell.

:R-pentomino This is by far the most active polyomino with less than six cells: all the others stabilize in at most 10 generations, but the R-pentomino does not do so until generation 1103, by which time it has a population of 116, including six gliders.

At generation 774, an R-pentomino produces a queen bee which lasts 17 more generations before being destroyed, enough time for it to flip over. This observation led to the discovery of the Gosper glider gun.
:RRO = reflectorless rotating oscillator

:rule 22 Wolfram's rule 22 is the 2-state 1-D cellular automaton in which a cell is ON in the next generation if and only if exactly one of its three neighbours is ON in the current generation (a cell being counted as a neighbour of itself). This is the behaviour of Life on a cylinder of width 1.

:Rx202 A composite conduit, one of the original sixteen Herschel conduits, discovered by Dave Buckingham in May 1997. It is made up of two elementary conduits, HR143B + BFx59H. After 202 ticks, it produces an inverted Herschel turned 90 degrees clockwise at (7, 32) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 201 ticks. A ghost Herschel in the pattern below marks the output location:

:salvo A collection of spaceships, usually gliders, all travelling in the same direction. Any valid glider construction recipe can be partitioned into no more than four salvos. Compare flotilla. In contrast with a convoy, the spaceships in a salvo are usually consumed by the reactions that they cause. Simple examples include block pusher and block pull.

Salvos may be slow or synchronized. The following partially synchronized three-glider salvo produces an LWSS from a block.

The above is a synchronized salvo and not a slow salvo, because the second glider must follow the first with the exact separation shown. The third glider can be considered to be a slow glider, because it will still delete the temporary loaf no matter how many ticks it is delayed. The slow glider construction entry includes an example of a true slow salvo.
:sawtooth Any finite pattern whose population grows without bound but does not tend to infinity. (In other words, the population reaches new heights infinitely often, but also infinitely often returns to some fixed value.) Conway's preferred plural is "sawteeth".

The first sawtooth was constructed by Dean Hickerson in April 1991. The current smallest known sawtooth was found by a conwaylife.com forum user with the online handle 'thunk'. It has a bounding box of 74Ã—60, and is the smallest known sawtooth in terms of its minimum repeating population of 177 cells. The following variant has a higher repeating population of 194 and an optimized bounding box of 62Ã—56:

:Schick engine (c/2 orthogonally, p12) This spaceship, found by Paul Schick in 1972, produces a large spark (the 15 live cells at the rear in the phase shown below) which can be perturbed by other c/2 spaceships to form a variety of puffers. See blinker ship for an example perturbation of the spark. The diagram below shows the smallest form of the Schick engine, using two LWSS. It is also possible to use two MWSSes or two HWSSes, or even an LWSS and an HWSS.

:search program A computer program or script that automates the search for Life objects having certain desired properties. These are used because the difficulty of finding previously unknown Life objects now commonly exceeds the patience, speed, and accuracy of humans. Various types of search programs are used for finding objects such as spaceships, oscillators, drifters, catalysts, soups, Gardens of Eden, and slow salvos.

Some search programs generate partial results as they are running, so even if they don't complete successfully, something of use might still be salvaged from the run.

Example search programs are dr, lifesrc, gfind, and Bellman.

There are other types of programs which don't perform searches as such, but instead perform large constructions. These are used to correctly complete very complicated objects such as the Caterpillar, Gemini, Caterloopillar, and universal constructor-based spaceships such as the Demonoids and Orthogonoids.

:second glider domain The second glider domain of an edge shooter is the set of spacetime offsets, relative to the glider stream emitted by the edge shooter, where a second independent glider stream may be present without interfering with the edge shooter. This is useful to know, because edge shooters are often used to generate glider streams very close to other glider streams, to make for example a spaceship gun or converter.

:second natural glider The glider produced at T=72 during the evolution of a Herschel. This is the common edge-shooting glider output used in the NW31 converter and several other converter variants.

:seed A constellation of still lifes and/or oscillators, which can be converted into another Life object when it is struck by one or more gliders. Usually the resulting object is a rare still life or spaceship, more complex than the original constellation. Spartan single-glider (1G) seeds are more commonly seen than multi-glider seeds, because a Spartan 1G seed can be readily constructed and triggered using a slow salvo. See also freeze-dried. For example, the following is a 14sL 1G seed for a c/7 loafer spaceship.

:Seeds of Destruction Game An interactive search application written by Paul Chapman in 2013. Its primary purpose was to assist in the design of self-destruct circuits in self-constructing circuitry. It has also regularly been helpful in completing glider syntheses, and was used to find the 31c/240 base reaction for the shield bug and Centipede spaceships.

:self-constructing A type of pattern, generally a macro-spaceship, that contains encoded construction information about itself, and makes a complete copy of itself using those instructions. The Gemini, linear propagator, spiral growth patterns, Demonoids and Orthogonoid are examples of self-constructing patterns. Self-constructing spaceships often have trivially adjustable speeds. In many cases, the direction of travel can also be altered, less easily, by changing the encoded construction recipe. Compare self-supporting, elementary.

:self-supporting A type of pattern, specifically a macro-spaceship, that constructs signals or tracks or other scaffolding to assist its movement, but does not contain complete information about its own structure. Examples include the Caterpillar, Centipede, half-baked knightship, waterbear, and the Caterloopillars. Caterpillar has been used as a general term for self-supporting spaceships, but it is not very appropriate for the HBKs.

In general a self-supporting pattern cannot be trivially adjusted to alter its speed or direction. The variable speeds of the HBKs and the Caterloopillars are exceptions, but their direction of travel is fixed, and a specific Caterloopillar can't be made to change its speed without completely rebuilding it. Compare self-constructing, elementary.

:semi-cenark Either of two semi-Snark variants discovered by Tanner Jacobi in November 2017. The name is due to the initial converter, which produces a century output for every two input gliders. The minimum safe repeat time is 43 ticks for the smaller initial catalyst shown in CC semi-cenark and CP semi-cenark, or 42 ticks with the slightly larger catalyst variant shown below. There is also overclocking possible at period 36, 38, or 39. The reset glider can be followed immediately by a new trigger glider, as shown below, so the minimum repeat time for an intermittent stream of gliders is only 50 ticks.

:semi-Snark Any small stable signal conduit that produces one output glider for every two input gliders, with a 90 degree reflection. These can act as period-doublers for any glider stream whose period is at least equal to their repeat time, and so adding one of these to a single glider gun often results in a pattern much smaller than the older technology of crossing the output of two guns.

The available semi-Snarks differ in their complexity, size, repeat time, and the colour of their output gliders. The CC semi-Snark was the first one found, and the term "semi-Snark" is often used specifically for this object. The "CC" prefix stands for colour-changing, by contrast with the more recently discovered colour-preserving CP semi-Snark.

There are also CC and CP variants of a semi-Snark based on a two-glider to century converter discovered by Tanner Jacobi in November 2017. These semi-cenarks are the fastest semi-Snarks known as of July 2018, with a repeat time as low as 50 ticks, or a periodic input rate as low as 36 ticks.

:signal Movement of information through the Life universe. Signals can be carried by spaceships, fuses, drifters, or conduits. Spaceships can only transfer a signal at the speed of the spaceship, while fuses can transfer a signal at speeds up to the speed of light.

In practice, many signals are encoded as the presence or absence of a glider or other spaceship at a particular point at a particular time. Such signals can be combined by the collision of gliders to form logic operations such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. Signals can be duplicated using glider duplicators or other fanout devices, and can be used up by causing perturbations on other parts of the Life object.

Signals are used in Herschel conduit circuitry, universal constructors, macro-spaceships, and other computational patterns such as the pi calculator and Osqrtlogt patterns.

:signal elbow A conduit with signal output 90 degrees from its input. This term is commonly used only for signal wires, particularly 2c/3 signals. A Snark could reasonably be called a "glider elbow", but glider reflector is the standard term. A signal elbow with a recovery time less than 20 ticks would enable a trivial proof that Conway's Life is omniperiodic.

A near miss is the following elbow-like converter found by Dean Hickerson. It successfully turns a 2c/3 signal by 90 degrees, but unfortunately changes it to a double-length signal in the process. This means that further copies of the converter can not be appended (e.g., to make a closed loop).

Relatively small composite MWSS elbows can now be constructed, using Tanner Jacobi's 2015 discovery of a small H-to-MWSS component. For example, the Orthogonoid includes a constructor/reflector that reflects an MWSS stream by 180 degrees, but it can be trivially reconfigured to make a 90-degree MWSS elbow.

:Silver G-to-H A variant of the Silver reflector made by substituting an Fx119 conduit for the final NW31, allowing a Herschel output as well as the beehive-annihilating reset glider. It is still Spartan, and as long as the Fx119 is followed by a dependent conduit, it retains the faster 497-tick recovery time.

:Silver reflector A stable glider reflector found by Stephen Silver in November 1998, by substituting an NW31 converter for the second Fx77 conduit in the Callahan G-to-H found a few days previous. The repeat time is 497 ticks:

:Simkin glider gun (p120) A Herschel-based glider gun discovered by Michael Simkin in April 2015. It consists of a Herschel running through two B60 conduits. In terms of its 36-cell minimum population, it is one of the smallest known guns, sharing the record with the Gosper glider gun. In the double-barreled form, as well as the pseudo-period, snake-stabilized form shown below, it is the absolute record holder.

:single-arm A type of universal constructor using just one construction arm and slow salvo techniques to construct, usually, Spartan or near-Spartan circuitry. Compare two-arm.

:single-channel A type of universal constructor discovered and developed by Simon EkstrÃ¶m and others starting in December 2015. The initial elbow operation toolkit was near-minimal, with just one push, one pull, and one output glider of each colour (see colour of a glider). Later searches produced a much larger and more efficient library.

Single-channel recipes consist of a stream of gliders on a single lane and aimed at a construction elbow, usually separated from each other by at least 90 ticks. In spite of these strict limitations, single-channel recipes can be made to do surprising things. For example, it is possible to build a Snark directly on the construction lane of an active construction arm, starting from a single elbow block. This can allow the arm to reach efficiently around complex obstructions by bending itself through multiple lossless elbows. Known recipes can also remove an elbow when it is no longer needed, by controlled demolition of the Snark.

As of June 2018, almost all single-channel recipes are made up of singletons and synchronized pairs of gliders, but no synchronized triplets or larger groups. This is not an inherent limitation of single-channel construction, but rather a limitation in the search program used to find currently known single-channel toolkits.

A useful byproduct of this limitation is that single-channel recipes can be trivially adjusted to allow them to safely cross perpendicular data streams, including other single-channel recipes (or earlier parts of the same recipe). To avoid collisions with a crossing stream, each singleton glider or glider pair can safely be delayed by any even number of ticks, or technically by any multiple of the period of the current intermediate target. The final result of the construction will not be affected.

:single-channel Demonoid See Demonoid.

:single-lane = single-channel.

:singleton In single-channel recipes, a glider that is not synchronized with a neighboring glider in its stream. Compare glider pair.

:sL Abbreviation for still life, used most often in rough measurements of the complexity of a Spartan constellation.

:slide gun A gun which fires sideways from an extending arm. The arm consists of streams of spaceships which are pushing a pattern away from the body of the gun and releasing an output spaceship every time they do so. Each output spaceship therefore travels along a different path.

Dieter Leithner constructed the first slide gun in July 1994 (although he used the term "side shooting gun"). The following pattern shows the key reaction of this slide gun. The three gliders shown will push the block one cell diagonally, thereby extending the length of the arm by one cell, and at the same time they release an output glider sideways. (In 1999, Jason Summers constructed slide guns using other reactions.)

:sliding block memory A memory register whose value is stored as the position of a block. The block can be moved by means of glider collisions. See block pusher for an example.

In Conway's original formulation (as part of his proof of the existence of a universal computer in Life) two gliders were used to pull the block inwards by three diagonal spaces, as shown below, and thirty gliders were used to push it out by the same amount.

	OO..........
	OO..........
	............
	............
	............
	.........OOO
	OOO......O..
	O.........O.
	.O..........
Dean Hickerson later greatly improved on this, finding a way to pull a block inwards by one diagonal space using 2 gliders, and push it out the same distance using 3 gliders. In order for the memory to be of any use there also has to be a way to read the value held. It suffices to be able to check whether the value is zero (as Conway did), or to be able to detect the transition from one to zero (as Hickerson did).

Dean Hickerson's sliding block memory is used in Paul Chapman's URM, and the key salvos from it are used in several other complex constructions, such as David Bell's Collatz 5N+1 simulator and Adam P. Goucher's pi calculator and Spartan universal computer-constructor.

:slmake A search program published by Adam P. Goucher in May 2017. It accepts as input a constellation of sufficiently widely separated still lifes, and produces a glider stream that will perform a complete slow glider construction of that constellation, starting from a single block.

One of slmake's primary uses is to make self-constructing patterns much easier to design and build. It is capable of finding recipes not only for Spartan stable circuitry, but also for other useful non-Spartan circuits such as Snarks, syringes, and H-to-MWSS converters, provided that they are separated from other nearby objects by a sufficient amount of empty space.

:slow See slow glider construction.

:slow elbow A movable construction elbow that is controlled by a slow salvo, which most likely comes from a previous elbow in a multi-elbow construction arm. Unlike a standard elbow which is generally fixed on a single construction lane or at least within a narrow range, a slow elbow can move freely in two dimensions as long as there is room for it. Each slow elbow added to a construction arm results in an exponential increase in the cost (in gliders) of the final construction. Compare lossless elbow.

:slow glider construction Construction an object by a "slow salvo" of gliders all coming from the same direction, in such a way that timing of the gliders does not matter as long as they are not too close behind one another. This type of construction requires an initial seed object, such as a block, which is modified by each glider in turn until the desired object is produced.

In May 1997, Nick Gotts produced a slow glider construction of a block-laying switch engine from a block, using a slow salvo of 53 gliders. Constructions like this are important in the study of sparse Life, as they will occur naturally as gliders created in the first few generations collide with blonks and other debris.

Slow glider constructions are also useful in some designs for universal constructors. However, in this case the above definition is usually too restrictive, and it is desirable to allow constructions in which some gliders in the salvo are required to have a particular timing modulo 2 (a "p2 slow salvo"). This gives much greater flexibility, as blinkers can now be freely used in the intermediate construction steps. The Snarkmaker is a very large p2 slow salvo. A much smaller example is the following edgy construction of an eater1 starting from a block.

:smoke Debris that is fairly long-lived but eventually dies completely. Basically, a large spark. This term is used especially when talking about the output from a smoking ship. Some Herschel conduits such as Fx119 also create large amounts of smoke.

:smoking ship A spaceship which produces smoke. If the smoke extends past the edge of the rest of the spaceship, then it can be used to perturb other objects as the spaceship passes by. Running gliders into the smoke is often a good way to turn or duplicate them, or convert them into other objects. Sometimes the smoke from a smoking ship may itself be perturbed by accompanying spaceships in order to form a puffer. A simple example of a smoking ship is the Schick engine.

The stabilizers make the domino spark largely inaccessible, but the snacker is extensible, as shown in the next diagram, and so a more accessible p9 domino spark can be obtained.

:snake bit An alternative name for a boat-bit. Not a very sensible name, because various other things can be used instead of a snake. A snake, or alternatively an aircraft carrier, is the smallest object that can consume a glider stream by effectively acting as an eater for every two incoming gliders. The one-cell reduction from the smallest real eater, the seven-cell eater1, has been important when trying to construct recent sawtooths where the population must be minimized.

:Snarkmaker A single-channel stream of gliders that, when aimed to collide with an elbow block in a specific location, will perform a slow glider construction of a Snark, directly on the same lane as the incoming gliders. This allows a construction arm to add one or more lossless elbows, so that it can bend around multiple corners without an exponential increase in construction cost.

The Snarkmaker recipe used in the first single-channel Demonoid, Orthogonoid, and spiral growth patterns contains 2,254 gliders. This could be considerably reduced with a customized search program.

:SNG = second natural glider.

:soup A random initial pattern, either contained within a small area, or alternatively filling the whole Life universe.

Finite soups probably have behaviors very different than infinite soups, but this is obviously unknown. Infinite soups may remain chaotic indefinitely since any reaction, no matter how rare, is bound to happen somewhere.

Soups can have an average density, with results varying based on that. See sparse Life for a discussion of what can happen at a low density.

Finite soups for sizes such as 16Ã—16 (asymmetric) have been examined by the billions by scripts such as apgsearch to find interesting results. Many new oscillators and synthesis recipes have been discovered, as well as previously known rare patterns such as stabilized switch engines. In addition, soups are used to generate statistical census data, and to decide whether specific objects can be considered natural.

Soups can be fully random, or they can be forced to be symmetric. The results for these two types of soups can differ since symmetric soups tend to create large symmetrical objects at a much higher rate. Shown below is an unusual mirror-symmetric soup that produces a pufferfish and nothing else.

:space dust A part of a spaceship or oscillator which looks like a random mix of ON and OFF cells. It is usually very difficult to find a glider synthesis for an object that consists wholly or partly of space dust. As examples, the 295P5H1V1, fly, and seal spaceships contain large amounts of space dust.

:spacefiller Any pattern that grows at a quadratic rate by filling space with an agar. The first example was found in September 1993 by Hartmut Holzwart, following a suggestion by Alan Hensel. The diagram below shows a smaller spacefiller found by Tim Coe. See also Max. Spacefillers can be considered as breeders (more precisely, MMS breeders), but they are very different from ordinary breeders. The word "spacefiller" was suggested by Harold McIntosh and soon became the accepted term.

:spaceship Any finite pattern that reappears (without additions or losses) after a number of generations and displaced by a non-zero amount. By far the most natural spaceships are the glider, LWSS, MWSS and HWSS, followed by the Coe ship which has also evolved multiple times from random asymmetric soup starting conditions. See also the entries on individual spaceship speeds: c/2 spaceship, c/3 spaceship, c/4 spaceship, c/5 spaceship, c/6 spaceship, c/7 spaceship, c/10 spaceship, c/12 spaceship, 2c/5 spaceship, 2c/7 spaceship, 3c/7 spaceship, (2,1)c/6 spaceship, and 17c/45 spaceship.

It is known that there exist spaceships travelling in all rational directions and at arbitrarily slow speeds (see universal constructor). Before 1989, however, the only known examples travelled at c/4 diagonally (gliders) or c/2 orthogonally (everything else).

In 1989 Dean Hickerson started to use automated searches to look for new elementary spaceships, and had considerable success. Other people have continued these searches using tools such as lifesrc and gfind, and as a result we now have a great variety of elementary spaceships travelling at sixteen different velocities. The following table details the discovery of elementary spaceships with new velocities as of July 2018.

Several infinite families of adjustable-velocity macro-spaceships have also been constructed, of which the first was Gabriel Nivasch's Caterpillar from December 2004. The macro-spaceship with the widest range of possible speeds is Michael Simkin's Caterloopillar from April 2016; in theory it supports any rational orthogonal speed strictly less than c<4. A somewhat similar design supporting any rational speed strictly less than c/2 has been shown to be feasible, but as of July 2018 no explicit examples have been constructed.

A period p spaceship that displaces itself (m,n) during its period, where m>=n, is said to be of type (m,n)/p. It was proved by Conway in 1970 that p>=2m+2n. (This follows immediately from the easily-proved fact that a pattern cannot advance diagonally at a rate greater than one half diagonal step every other generation.)

:Spaceships in Conway's Life A series of articles posted by David Bell to the newsgroup comp.theory.cell-automata during the period August-October 1992 that described many of the new spaceships found by himself, Dean Hickerson and Hartmut Holzwart. Bell produced an addendum covering more recent developments in 1996.

:spaghetti monster The first 3c/7 spaceship, found by Tim Coe in June 2016. The spaceship travels orthogonally, has a minimum of 702 live cells and fits in a 27Ã—137 bounding box.

:spark A pattern that dies. The term is typically used to describe a collection of cells periodically thrown off by an oscillator or spaceship, but other dying patterns, particularly those consisting or only one or two cells (such as produced by certain glider collisions, for example), are also described as sparks. For examples of small sparks see unix and HWSS. Examples of much larger sparks are seen in Schick engine and twin bees shuttle spark.

:spark coil (p2) Found in 1971.

:sparker An oscillator or spaceship that produces sparks. These can be used to perturb other patterns without being themselves affected.

:sparking eater One of two eaters found in April 1997 and November 1998 by Dean Hickerson using his dr search program, shown below to the left and right respectively. These both absorb gliders as a standard eater does, but also produce separated single-bit sparks at the upper right, which can be used to delete antiparallel gliders with different phases as shown.

The above mechanisms can be used to build intermitting glider guns. The left-hand eater produces a spark nine ticks after a glider impact, with the result that the period of the constituent guns can't be a multiple of 4. The right-hand eater produces the same spark ten ticks after impact, which allows p4N guns to be used.
The separation of the spark also allows this reaction to perform other perturbations "around the corner" of some objects. For example, it was used by Jason Summers in 2004 to cap the ends of a row of ten AK47 reactions to form a much smaller period 94 glider gun than the original one. (This is now made obsolete by the AK94 gun.)

:sparse Life This refers to the study of the evolution of a Life universe which starts off as a random soup of extremely low density. Such a universe is dominated at an early stage by blocks and blinkers (often referred to collectively as blonks) in a ratio of about 2:1. Much later it will be dominated by simple infinite growth patterns (presumably mostly switch engines). The long-term fate of a sparse Life universe is less certain. It may possibly become dominated by self-reproducing patterns (see universal constructor), but it is not at all clear that there is any mechanism for these to deal with all the junk produced by switch engines.

:Spartan A pattern composed of subunits that can be easily constructed in any orientation, usually with a slow salvo. Generally this means that the pattern is a constellation of Spartan still lifes: block, tub, boat, hive, ship, loaf, eater1, or pond. Other small objects may sometimes be counted as Spartan, including period-2 oscillators - mainly blinkers, but also beacons or toads, which may occur as intermediate targets in slow salvo recipes. Most self-constructing patterns are Spartan or mostly Spartan, to simplify the process of self-construction.

:speed booster Any mechanism which allows a signal (indicated by the presence or absence of a spaceship) to move faster than the spaceship could travel through empty space. The original speed booster is based on p30 technology, and is shown below:

Here the top glider is boosted by passing through two inline inverters, emerging 5 cells further along than the unboosted glider at the left.
The fastest speed boosters are the telegraph and p1 telegraph, which can transfer a orthogonal signal at the speed of light, although their bit rate is rather slow.

Diagonal speed boosters have also been built using 2c/3 wires or other stable components. See stable pseudo-Heisenburp.

The star gate seems like it can transfer a signal faster than the speed of light. The illusion is explained in Fast Forward Force Field.

:speed of light The greatest speed at which any effect can propagate; in Life, a speed of one cell per generation. Usually denoted c.

:spiral growth A self-constructing pattern built by Dave Greene in August 2014 that uses four universal constructors (UCs) arranged in a diamond to build four more UCs in a slightly larger diamond. This was the first B3/S23 pattern that exhibited spiral growth. Much smaller versions have now been constructed using the single-channel construction toolkit.

:splitter A signal converter that accepts a single input signal and produces two or more output signals, usually of the same type as the input. An older term for this is fanout, or "fanout device".

A sub-category is the one-time splitter, which is not technically a converter because it can only be used once. One-time splitters are usually small constellations that produce two or more clean gliders when struck by a single glider. In other words, they are multi-glider seeds. These are important for constructing self-destruct circuitry in self-constructing spaceships.

The following combination, a syringe attached to an SE7T14 converter combined with an NW31 converter, is one of the smallest known glider splitters as of July 2018. Another small splitter with a 90-degree colour-changing output is shown under reflector.

:stabilized switch engine A single switch engine which survives indefinitely by interacting with the appropriate exhaust such that it prevents the engine from ever being destroyed.

The only known types of stabilized switch engines were found by Charles Corderman soon after he discovered the switch engine itself. There is a p288 block-laying type (the more common of the two) and the p384 glider-producing type. These two puffers are the most natural infinite growth patterns in Life. As of June 2018 they are the basis for every infinite growth pattern ever seen to occur from a random asymmetric soup, even after trillions of census results by apgsearch and similar projects.

Patterns giving rise to block-laying switch engines can be seen under infinite growth, and one giving rise to a glider-producing switch engine is shown under time bomb.

Here is the block-laying type showing its distinctive zig-zag trail of blocks.

:stable A pattern is said to be stable if it is a parent of itself. Stable objects are oscillators with period 1 (p1), and are generally called still lifes.

:stable pseudo-Heisenburp A multi-stage converter constructed by Dave Greene in January 2007, using a complex recipe found by Noam Elkies to insert a signal into a 2c/3 wire. The wire's high transmission speed allows a signal from a highway robber to catch up to a salvo of gliders. Ultimately the mechanism restores the key glider, which was destroyed by the highway robber in the first stage of the converter, to its exact original position in the salvo.

Much smaller stable pseudo-Heisenburp devices have since been designed that use simple 0-degree glider seed constellations instead of a 2c/3 wire.

These patterns are labeled "pseudo-Heisenburp", because a true Heisenburp device does not even temporarily damage or affect a passing glider, yet can still produce an output signal in response. However, it is impossible to construct a stable device that can accomplish this for gliders. True stable Heisenburp devices are possible with many other types of spaceships, but not with gliders which have no usable side sparks to initiate an output signal.

:staged recovery A type of signal-processing circuit where the initial reaction between catalysts an incoming signal results in an imperfect recovery. A catalyst is damaged, destroyed completely as in a bait reaction, or one or more objects are left behind that must be cleaned up before the circuit can be reused. In any of these three cases, output signals from the circuit must be used to complete the cleanup. In theory the cleanup process might itself be dirty, requiring additional cleanup stages. In rare cases this might theoretically allow the construction of special-purpose circuits with a lower recovery time than would otherwise be possible, but in practice this kind of situation does not commonly arise.

An example is the record-breaking (at the time) 487-tick reflector constructed by Adam P. Goucher on 12 April 2009. 487 ticks was a slight improvement over the repeat time of the Silver reflector. The reflector featured a standard Callahan G-to-H, with cleanup by an internal dirty glider reflector found by Dieter Leithner many years before. This in turn was cleaned up by the usual ungainly Herschel plumbing attached to the G-to-H's output. The dirty glider reflector is not actually fully recovered before a second p487 signal enters the full reflector. However, it has been repaired by the time the internal reflector is actually needed again, so the cycle can be successfully repeated at p487 instead of p497.

:stairstep hexomino (stabilizes at time 63) The following predecessor of the blockade.

:stamp collection A collection of oscillators (or perhaps other Life objects) in a single diagram, displaying the exhibits much like stamps in a stamp album. The classic examples are by Dean Hickerson (see http://conwaylife.com/ref/DRH/stamps.html).

Many stamp collections contain "fonts" made of single cells (which cleanly die) to annotate the objects or to draw boxes around them. For example, here is a stamp collection which shows all the ways that two gliders can create a loaf or an eater:

Alternatively, stamp collections can use LifeHistory for their annotations, but this requires a more sophisticated Life program to handle. Numbers, or more rarely letters, are sometimes constructed from stable components such as blocks or snakes, but their readability is somewhat limited by placement constraints.

:star gate A device by Dieter Leithner (October 1996) for transporting a LWSS faster than the speed of light. The key reaction is the Fast Forward Force Field.

:stator The cells of an oscillator that are always on. Compare rotor. (The stator is sometimes taken to include also some of those cells which are always off.) The stator is divided into the bushing and the casing.

By analogy, the cells of an eater that remain on even when the eater is eating are considered to constitute the stator of the eater. This is not always well-defined, because an eater can have more than one eating action.

:statorless A statorless oscillator is one in which no cell is permanently on - that is, the stator is empty, or in other words the oscillator has the maximum possible volatility. See the volatility entry for examples of this type of oscillator at different periods. Statorless oscillators can be constructed for any sufficiently large period, using universal constructor technology.

:statorless p5 (p5) Found by Josh Ball, June 2016. The first and only known statorless period 5 oscillator.

:still life Any stable pattern, usually assumed to be finite and nonempty. For the purposes of enumerating still lifes this definition is, however, unsatisfactory because, for example, any pair of blocks would count as a still life, and there would therefore be an infinite number of 8-bit still lifes.

For this reason a stricter definition is often used, counting a stable pattern as a strict still life only if its islands cannot be divided into two or more nonempty sets both of which are stable in their own right. If such a subdivision can be made, the pattern can be referred to as a constellation. If its cells form a single cluster it is also, more specifically, either a pseudo still life or a quasi still life.

In rare cases above a certain size threshold, a pattern may be divisible into three or four stable nonempty subsets but not into two. See the 32-bit triple pseudo (32 bits) and the 34-bit quad pseudo for examples.

All still lifes up to 18 bits have been shown to be glider constructible. It is an open question whether all still lifes can be incrementally constructed using glider collisions. For a subset of small still lifes that have been found to be especially useful in self-constructing circuitry, see also Spartan.

The smallest still life is the block. Arbitrarily large still lifes are easy to construct, for example by extending a canoe or barge. The maximum density of a large still life is 1/2, which can be achieved by an arbitrarily large patch of zebra stripes or chicken wire, among many other options. See density for more precise limits.

:stop and restart A type of signal circuit where an input signal is converted into a stationary object, which is then re-activated by a secondary input signal. This can be used either as a memory device storing one bit of information, or as a simple delay mechanism. In the following January 2016 example by Martin Grant, a ghost Herschel marks the output signal location, and a "ghost beehive" marks the location of the intermediate still life.

The eater1 in the lower left corner catches the restart glider if no input signal has come in to create the beehive. This eater could be removed if it is useful to have both a "0" and a "1" output for a memory cell mechanism.
The catch and throw technology in a Caterpillar is a somewhat similar idea. See also stop and go and reanimation.

:stream A line of identical objects (usually spaceships), each of which is moving in a direction parallel to the line, generally on the same lane. In many uses the stream is periodic. For example, the new gun produces a period 46 glider stream. The stream produced by a pseudo-random glider generator can have a very high period. Compare with wave. See also single-channel for a common use of non-periodic glider streams.

:stretcher Any pattern that grows by stretching a wick or agar. See wickstretcher and spacefiller.

:strict still life A still life that is either a single connected polyplet, or is arranged such that a stable smaller pattern cannot be formed by removing one or more of its islands. For example, beehive with tail is a strict still life because it is connected, and table on table is a strict still life because neither of the tables are stable by themselves. See also triple pseudo, quad pseudo.

Still lifes have been enumerated by Conway (4-7 bits), Robert Wainwright (8-10 bits), Dave Buckingham (11-13 bits), Peter Raynham (14 bits), Mark Niemiec (15-24 bits), and Simon EkstrÃ¶m and Nathaniel Johnston (25-32 bits). The resulting figures are shown below; see also https://oeis.org/A019473. The most recent search by Nathaniel Johnston has also confirmed that the triple pseudo pattern found by Gabriel Nivasch is the only such still life with 32 bits or less. It is therefore included in the pseudo still life count and not in the table below.

As the number of bits increases, the strict still life count goes up exponentially by approximately O(2.46n). By comparison, the rate for pseudo still life}s is about O(2.56n) while for quasi still lifes it's around O(3.04n).

:strict volatility A term suggested by Noam Elkies in August 1998 for the proportion of cells involved in a period n oscillator which themselves oscillate with period n. For prime n this is the same as the ordinary volatility. Periods with known strictly-volatile oscillators include 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 15, 22, 30, 33, and 177. Examples include figure-8, Kok's galaxy, smiley, and pentadecathlon. A composite example is the following p22, found by Nicolay Beluchenko on 4 March 2009:

:superlinear growth Growth faster than any rate proportional to T, where T is the number of ticks that a pattern has been run. This term usually applies to a pattern's population growth, rather than diametric growth or bounding-box growth. For example, breeders' and spacefillers' population asymptotically grows faster than any linear-growth pattern. It may also be used to describe the rate of increase in the number of subpatterns present in a pattern, such as when describing a replicator's rate of reproduction. Due to limits enforced by the speed of light, no pattern's population can grow at an asymptotic rate faster than quadratic growth. See switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population superlinear growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the record-holders.

:superstring An infinite orthogonal row of cells stabilized on one side so that it moves at the speed of light, often leaving debris behind. The first examples were found in 1971 by Edward Fitzgerald and Robert Wainwright. Superstrings were studied extensively by Peter Rott during 1992-1994, and he found examples with many different periods. (But no odd periods. In August 1998 Stephen Silver proved that odd-period superstrings are impossible.)

Sometimes a finite section of a superstring can be made to run between two tracks ("waveguides"). This gives a fuse which can be made as wide as desired. The first example was found by Tony Smithurst and uses tubs. (This is shown below. The superstring itself is p4 with a repeating section of width 9 producing one blinker per period and was one of those discovered in 1971. With the track in place, however, the period is 8. This track can also be used with a number of other superstrings.) Shortly after seeing this example, in March 1997 Peter Rott found another superstring track consisting of boats. At present these are the only two waveguides known. Both are destroyed by the superstring as it moves along. It would be interesting to find one that remains intact.

See titanic toroidal traveler for another example of a superstring.

:support Those parts of an object which are only present in order to keep the rest of the object (such an engine or an edge spark) working correctly. These can be components of the object, or else accompanying objects used to perturb the object. In many cases there is a wide variation of support possible for an engine. The arms in many puffers are an example of support.

:SW1T43 A Herschel-to-glider converter that produces a tandem glider useful in the tee reaction. It is classified as a "G3" converter because its two gliders are three lanes apart.

Besides the southwest-travelling glider on lane 1, the converter also emits the Herschel's standard first natural glider, SW-2. The converter's full standard name is therefore "HSW1T43_SW-2T21". See NW31 for an explanation of H-to-G naming conventions.
:SW-2 The simplest type of H-to-G converter, where the converter's effect is simply to suppress a Herschel cleanly after allowing its first natural glider to escape. The name should be read as "SW minus two", where -2 is a glider lane number. The complete designation is SW-2T21. See NW31T120 for a discussion of the standard naming conventions used for these converters.

An unlimited number of converters have the SW-2T21 classification. The variants most often used consist of just one or two small still life catalysts.

:switch A signal-carrying circuit that can send output signals to two or more different locations, depending on the state of the mechanism. These may be toggle circuits, where the state of the switch changes after each use, or permanent switches that retain the same state through many uses until a change is made with a separate signal.

More generally, any circuit may be referred to as a switch, if it can alter its output based on stored information. For example, the following simple mechanism based on an eater2 was discovered by Emerson J. Perkins in 2007. It either reflects or absorbs an incoming signal, depending on the presence or absence of a nearby block. The block is removed if a reflection occurs.

The switching signal here is a glider produced by a high-clearance syringe variant found by Matthias Merzenich. The syringe is not technically part of the switch mechanism; any standard Herschel source can deliver the signal to the block factory (the two eater1s on the right side of the pattern). Alternate converter mechanisms could also be used to place the block.

An earlier example of the same type of one-time switch mechanism, also mediated by a block, can be found in the NW34T204 H-to-G. See also bistable switch for a very robust and versatile toggle switch with two input lanes and four possible outputs.

:switchable gun A gun that includes a mechanism to turn the output stream off and on with simple signals, often gliders. A small example is Dieter Leithner's switchable LWSS gun from July 8, 1995. The ON signal enters from the northeast, and the OFF signal from the northwest:

:switch engine The following pattern discovered by Charles Corderman in 1971, which is a glide symmetric unstable puffer which moves diagonally at a speed of c/12 (8 cells every 96 generations).

	.O.O..
	O.....
	.O..O.
	...OOO
The exhaust is dirty and unfortunately catches up and destroys the switch engine before it runs 13 full periods. Corderman found several ways to stabilize the switch engine to produce puffers, using either one or two switch engines in tandem. See stabilized switch engine and ark.

No spaceships were able to be made from switch engines until Dean Hickerson found the first one in April 1991 (see Cordership). Switch engine technology is now well-advanced, producing many c/12 diagonal spaceships, puffers, and rakes of many periods.

Small polyominoes exist whose evolution results in a switch engine. See nonomino switch engine predecessor.

Several three-glider collisions produce dirty reactions that produce a stabilized switch engine along with other ash, making infinite growth. Until recently the only known syntheses for clean unstabilized switch engines used four or more gliders. There are several such recipes. In the reaction shown below no glider arrives from the direction that the switch engine will travel to, making it easier to repeat the reaction:

Running the above for 20 ticks completes a kickback reaction with the top two gliders, resulting in the three-glider switch engine recipe discovered by Luka Okanishi on 12 March 2017.

:switch-engine ping-pong A very large (210515Ã—183739) quadratic growth pattern found by Michael Simkin in October 2014. Currently this is the smallest starting population (23 cells) known to result in a quadratic population growth rate. Previous record-holders include Jaws, mosquito1, mosquito2, mosquito3, mosquito4, mosquito5, teeth, catacryst, metacatacryst, Gotts dots, wedge, 26-cell quadratic growth, 25-cell quadratic growth, and 24-cell quadratic growth.

:symmetric Any object which can be rotated and/or flipped over an axis and still maintain the same shape. Many common small objects such as the block, beehive, pond, loaf, clock, and blinker are symmetric. Some larger symmetric objects are Kok's galaxy, Achim's p16, cross, Eureka, and the pulsar.

Large symmetric objects can easily be created by placing multiple copies of any finite object together in a symmetrical way. Unless the individual objects interact significantly, this is considered trivial and is not considered further here (e.g., two LWSSs travelling together a hundred cells apart).

There are two kinds of symmetry. Odd symmetry occurs when an object's line of reflection passes through the center of a line of cells. Objects with odd symmetry have an odd number of columns or rows, and can have a gutter. Even symmetry occurs when the line of reflection follows the boundary between two lines of cells. Objects with even symmetry have an even number of columns or rows.

Because the Life universe and its rules are symmetric, all symmetric objects must remain symmetric throughout their evolution. Most non-symmetric objects keep their non-symmetry as they evolve, but some can become symmetric, especially if they result in a single object. Here is a slightly more complicated example where two gliders interact to form a blockade:

	..O.........
	O.O.........
	.OO........O
	.........OO.
	..........OO
Many useful objects are symmetric along an orthogonal axis. This commonly occurs by placing two copies of an object side by side to change the behaviour of the objects due to the inhibition or killing of new cells at their gutter interface. Examples of this are twin bees shuttle, centinal, and the object shown in puffer. Other useful symmetric objects are created by perturbing a symmetric object using nearby oscillators or spaceships in a symmetric manner. Examples of this are Schick engine, blinker ship, and hivenudger.

Many spaceships found by search programs are symmetric because the search space for such objects is much smaller than for non-symmetrical spaceships. Examples include dart, 60P5H2V0, and 119P4H1V0.

:synchronized Indicates that precise relative timing is required for two or more input signals entering a circuit, or two or more sets of gliders participating in a glider synthesis. Compare asynchronous. See also salvo and slow glider construction.

:synchronous = synchronized

:synthesis = glider synthesis

:syringe A small stable converter found by Tanner Jacobi in March 2015, accepting a glider as input and producing an output Herschel As of June 2018 it is the smallest known converter of this type, so it is very often used to handle input gliders in complex signal circuitry, as described in Herschel circuit. A second glider can safely follow the first any time after 78 ticks, but overclocking also allows the syringe to work at a repeat time of 74 or 75 ticks. If followed by a dependent conduit a simple eater2 can be used instead of the large welded catalyst shown here. A ghost Herschel marks the output location.

:tag = tagalong

:tagalong An object which is not a spaceship in its own right, but which can be attached to one or more spaceships to form a larger spaceship. For examples see Canada goose, fly, pushalong, sidecar and sparky. See also Schick engine, which consists of a tagalong attached to two LWSS (or similar).

The following c/4 spaceship (Nicolay Beluchenko, February 2004) has two wings, either of which can be considered as a tagalong. But if either wing is removed, then the remaining wing becomes an essential component of the spaceship, and so is no longer a tagalong.

The snakes can be replaced with eaters to form a slightly smaller version, as shown in the p46 MWSS gun in gliderless
The period of this new oscillator is the same as the old twin bees shuttle, and so this is able to expand the known p46 technology. For example, a p46 glider gun can be made from a Tanner's p46 and just one of the twin bees shuttles.

Acting on their own, two copies of Tanner's p46 placed at right angles to each other with their sparks interacting can produce two different p46 glider guns and a gliderless p46 MWSS gun. See p46 gun and gliderless for two of these. These are the first p46 guns found which do not use a twin bees shuttle at all.

:target A necessary component of a slow salvo recipe used by a single-arm universal constructor. A target usually consists of a single object, or sometimes a small constellation of common still lifes and/or oscillators. See intermediate target. If no hand target is available, a construction arm may be unable to construct anything, unless recipes are available to generate targets directly from the elbow.

:teardrop The following induction coil, or the formation of two beehives that it evolves into after 20 generations. (Compare butterfly, where the beehives are five cells further apart.)

:technology The collective set of known reactions exploiting one subset of the Life universe. Examples of these subsets include glider synthesis, period 30 glider streams, c/3 spaceships, sparkers, Herschel conduits, and slow salvos. As new reactions and objects are found, over time any particular technology becomes more versatile and complete. Many Life experts like to concentrate on particular technologies.

:tee A head-on collision between three gliders, producing a perpendicular output glider that can be used to construct closely spaced glider salvos, or to inject a glider into an existing stream. There are several workable recipes. One of the more useful is the following, because the tandem glider can be generated by a small Herschel converter, SW1T43:

:teeth A 65-cell quadratic growth pattern found by Nick Gotts in March 2000. This (and a related 65-cell pattern which Gotts found at about the same time) beat the record previously held by mosquito5 for smallest population known to have superlinear growth, but was later superseded by catacryst. See switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population superlinear growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the record-holders.

:telegraph A pattern created by Jason Summers in February 2003. It transmits and receives information using a rare type of reburnable fuse, a lightspeed wire made from a chain of beehives, at the rate of 1440 ticks per bit. The rate of travel of signals through the entire transceiver device can be increased to any speed strictly less than the speed of light by increasing the length of the beehive chain appropriately.

"Telegraph" may also refer to any device that sends and receives lightspeed signals; see also p1 telegraph, high-bandwidth telegraph.

:ternary reaction Any reaction between three objects. In particular, a reaction in which two gliders from one stream and one glider from a crossing stream of the same period annihilate each other. This can be used to combine two glider guns of the same period to produce a new glider gun with double the period.

The protruding cells at the edges can perturb some reactions by encouraging and then suppressing births on successive ticks. For example, a toad can replace the northwest eater in the Callahan G-to-H converter, allowing it to be packed one diagonal cell closer to other circuits.

:toad-flipper A toad hassler that works in the manner of the following example. Two domino sparkers, here pentadecathlons, apply their sparks to the toad in order to flip it over. When the sparks are applied again it is flipped back. Either or both domino sparkers can be moved down two spaces from the position shown and the toad-flipper will still work, but because of symmetry there are really only two different types. Compare toad-sucker.

:toggleable gun Any gun that can be turned off or turned on by the same external signal - the simplest possible switching mechanism. An input signal causes the gun to stop producing gliders. Another input signal from the same source restores the gun to its original function. Compare switchable gun.

In the figure above, glider B and an LWSS are about to send a glider NW. Glider A will delete the next glider after B, turning off the output stream. But if the device were already off, B wouldn't be present and A would instead delete the leading LWSS, turning the device back on.
:toggle circuit Any signal-processing circuit that switches back and forth between two possible states or outputs. An early example is the boat-bit. More recent discoveries include the semi-Snarks, which alternate between reflecting and absorbing input gliders. The following B-to-G converter sends alternate glider outputs in opposite directions.

:TOLLCASS Acronym for The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search.

:toolkit A set of Life reactions and mechanisms that can be used to solve any problem in a specific pre-defined class of problems: glider timing adjustment, salvo creation, seed construction, etc. See also universal toolkit, technology.

:torus As applies to Life, usually means a finite Life universe which takes the form of an m Ã— n rectangle with the bottom edge considered to be joined to the top edge and the left edge joined to the right edge, so that the universe is topologically a torus. There are also other less obvious ways of obtaining a toroidal universe.

See also Klein bottle. Every object in a torus universe obviously either dies or becomes a still life or oscillator.

:total aperiodic Any finite pattern which evolves in such a way that no cell in the Life plane is eventually periodic. The first example was found by Bill Gosper in November 1997. A few days later he found the following much smaller example consisting of three copies of a p12 backrake by Dave Buckingham.

:track A path made out of conduits, often ending where it begins so that the active signal object is cycled forever, forming an oscillator or a gun.

This term has also been used to refer to the lane on which a glider or spaceship travels. The concept is very similar, but a reference to a "track" now usually implies a non-trivial supporting conduit.

:transparent In signal circuitry, a term used for a catalyst that is completely destroyed by the passing signal, then rebuilt. Often (though not always) the active reaction passes directly through the area occupied by the transparent catalyst, then rebuilds the catalyst behind itself, as in the transparent block reaction. See also transparent lane.

:transparent block reaction A certain reaction between a block and a Herschel predecessor in which the block reappears in its original place some time later, the reaction having effectively passed through it. This reaction was found by Dave Buckingham in 1988. It has been used in some Herschel conduits, and in the gunstars. Because the reaction involves a Herschel predecessor rather than an actual Herschel, the following diagram shows instead a B-heptomino (which by itself would evolve into a block and a Herschel).

	O.............

:transparent debris effect A mechanism where a Herschel or other active reaction completely destroys a catalyst in a particular location in a conduit. After passing through or past that location, the same reaction then recreates the catalyst in exactly its original position. This type of catalysis is surprisingly common in signal circuitry. For an example, see transparent block reaction.

The transparent object is most often a very common still life such as a block or beehive. Rarer objects are not unknown; for example, a transparent loaf was found by Stephen Silver in October 1997, in a very useful elementary conduit making up part of a Herschel receiver. However, not surprisingly, rarer objects are much less likely to reappear in exactly the correct location and orientation, so transparent reactions involving them are much more difficult to find, on average.

:transparent lane A path through a signal-producing circuit that can be used to merge signal streams. The signal is usually a standard spaceship such as a glider. It can either be produced by the circuit, or it can come from elsewhere, passing safely through on the same lane without interacting with the circuit. A good example is the NW31 converter, which has two glider outputs on transparent lanes:

The optional third output shown in NW31 is non-transparent, because the upper eater1 catalyst would get in the way of a passing glider on the same lane.

:tremi-Snark A colour-preserving period-multiplying signal conduit found by Tanner Jacobi on 7 September 2017, producing one output glider for every three input gliders. It uses the same block-to-pre-honeyfarm bait reaction as the Snark, and so has the same 43-tick recovery time. Compare semi-Snark.

:trombone-slide An arrangement of four 90-degree reflectors that can be placed into the path of a glider so as to delay it by an adjustable number of generations, without changing its lane. More generally, any combination of circuits may be referred to as a trombone slide, if the grouping can be moved as a single unit that functions as a 180-degree glider reflector.

One-time turners may be 90-degree or 180-degree, or they may be 0-degree with the output in the same direction as the input. A reusable turner would instead be called a reflector. Shown on the top row below are the four 90-degree turner reactions that use common small ash objects: boat, eater1, long boat, and toad.

:turtle A spaceship found by Dean Hickerson in August 1989 that produces a domino spark at the back. Hickerson used this spark to convert an approaching HWSS into a loaf, as part of the first sawtooth. (Also see tractor beam). The shape of the back end of the turtle is distinctive. Very similar but wider back ends have been found in other c/3 ships to produce period 9 and 15 spaceships.

:twin-bees-shuttle Found by Bill Gosper in 1971, this was the basis of all known true p46 guns, and all known p46 oscillators except for glider signal loops using Snarks, until the discovery of Tanner's p46 in 2017. See new gun for an example. There are numerous ways to stabilize the ends, two of which are shown in the diagram. On the left is David Bell's double block reaction (which results in a shorter, but wider, shuttle than usual), and on the right is the stabilization by a single block. This latter method produces the very large twin bees shuttle spark which is useful in a number of ways. See metamorphosis for an example. Adding a symmetrically placed block below this one suppresses the spark. See also p54 shuttle.

:volatility The volatility of an oscillator is the size (in cells) of its rotor divided by the sum of the sizes of its rotor and its stator. In other words, it is the proportion of cells involved in the oscillator which actually oscillate. For many periods there are known oscillators with volatility 1, see for example Achim's p16, figure-8, Kok's galaxy, mazing, pentadecathlon, phoenix, relay, smiley and tumbler. Such an oscillator of period 3 was found in August 2012 by Jason Summers.

:wickstretcher A spaceship-like object which stretches a wick that is fixed at the other end. The wick here is assumed to be in some sense connected, otherwise most puffers would qualify as wickstretchers. The first example of a wickstretcher was found in October 1992 (front end by Hartmut Holzwart and back end by Dean Hickerson) and stretches ants at a speed of c/4. This is shown below with an improved back end found by Hickerson the following month.

:with the grain A term used for negative spaceships travelling in zebra stripes agar, parallel to the stripes, and also for with-the-grain grey ships. Below are three small examples of "negative spaceships" found by Gabriel Nivasch in July 1999, travelling with the grain through a stabilized finite segment of zebra stripes agar:

:worker bee (p9) Found by Dave Buckingham in 1972. Unlike the similar snacker this produces no sparks, and so is not very important. Like the snacker, the worker bee is extensible. It is, in fact, a finite version of the infinite oscillator which consists of six ON cells and two OFF cells alternating along a line. Note that Dean Hickerson's new snacker ends also work here.

:x66 Found by Hartmut Holzwart, July 1992. Half of this can be escorted by an HWSS. The name refers to the fact that every cell (live or dead) has at most 6 live neighbours (in contrast to spaceships based on LWSS, MWSS or HWSS). In fact this spaceship was found by a search with this restriction.

:zebra-stripes A stable agar consisting of alternating bands of live and dead cells. Known spacefillers and many gray ships create patches of this agar. It is also the medium through which with the grain and against the grain negative spaceships travel. Many simple stabilizations of the boundaries of finite regions of this agar are known, as shown below.
