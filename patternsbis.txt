:emu Dave Buckingham's term for a Herschel loop that does not emit gliders (and so is "flightless"). All known Herschel loops of periods 52, 57, 58, 59 and 61 are emus. See also Quetzal.

:emulator Any one of three p4 oscillators that produce sparks similar to those produced by LWSS, MWSS and HWSS. See LW emulator, MW emulator and HW emulator. Larger emulators are also possible, but they require stabilizing objects to suppress their non-sparks and so are of little use. The emulators were discovered by Robert Wainwright in June 1980.

:engine The active portion of an object (usually a puffer or gun) which is considered to actually produce its output, and which generally permits no variation in how it works. The other parts of the object are just there to support the engine. For examples, see puffer train, Schick engine, blinker puffer, frothing puffer and line puffer.

:engineless A rake or puffer which does not contain a specific engine for its operation. Instead it depends on perturbations of gliders or other objects by passing spaceships. The period of such objects is often adjustable, and in some cases the speed as well. An early example was the creation of c/5 rakes in September 1997, using gliders circulating among a convoy of c/5 spaceships. More recently, the passing spaceships themselves are also constructed, as in the Caterloopillar.

:evolution The process or result of running one or more generations of an object. For example, a row of 10 cells evolves into a pentadecathlon.

:evolutionary factor For an unstable pattern, the time to stabilization divided by the initial population. For example, the R-pentomino has an evolutionary factor of 220.6, while bunnies has an evolutionary factor of 1925.777... The term is no longer in use.

:exhaust The debris or smoke left behind by a puffer, especially if the debris is dirty and takes many generations to settle. The term is not usually used for the objects created by clean puffers.

:exponential filter A toolkit developed by Gabriel Nivasch in 2006, enabling the construction of patterns with asymptotic population growth matching O((log log ... log(t))) for any number of nested log operations. See also quadratic filter, recursive filter.

:exposure = underpopulation

:extensible A pattern is said to be extensible if arbitrarily large patterns of the same type can be made by repeating parts of the original pattern in a regular way. For examples, see p6 shuttle, pentoad, pufferfish spaceship, snacker, wavestretcher, wicktrailer and branching spaceship.

	:F116 An elementary conduit, one of the original sixteen Herschel conduits, discovered by Paul Callahan in February 1997. After 116 ticks, it produces a Herschel at (32, 1) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 138 ticks; this can be reduced to 120 ticks by adding extra mechanisms to suppress the internal glider. It is Spartan only if the following conduit is a dependent conduit, so that the welded FNG eater can be removed. A ghost Herschel in the pattern below marks the output location:

After 117 ticks, it produces a Herschel at (40, -6) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 63 ticks. It can be made Spartan by replacing the snake with an eater1 in one of two orientations.

:F166 A composite conduit, one of the original sixteen Herschel conduits, discovered by Paul Callahan in May 1997. It is composed of two elementary conduits, HFx107B + BFx59H. The F166 and Lx200 conduits are the two original dependent conduits (several more have since been discovered). After 166 ticks, it produces a Herschel at (49, 3) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 116 ticks. A ghost Herschel in the pattern below marks the output location:

The F166 can be made Spartan by replacing the snake with an eater1 in one of two orientations. The input shown here is a Herschel great-grandparent, since the input reaction is catalysed by the transparent block before the Herschel's standard form can appear.
:F171 An elementary conduit, the seventeenth Herschel conduit, discovered by Brice Due in August 2006 in a search using only eaters as catalysts. This was the first new Herschel conduit discovery since 1998. After 171 ticks, it produces a Herschel at (29, -17) relative to the input. A ghost Herschel in the pattern below marks the output location:

The conduit's recovery time is 227 ticks, slower than many of the original sixteen conduits because of the delayed destruction of a temporary blinker, though the circuit itself is clearly Spartan. The recovery time can be improved to 120 ticks by adding sparkers of various periods to suppress the blinker. See clock for a period-2 example.

The central eater in the group of three to the northwest can be removed to release an additional glider output signal on a transparent lane.

:factory Another word for gun, but not used in the case of glider guns. The term is also used for a pattern that repeatedly manufactures objects other than spaceships or rakes. In this case the new objects do not move out of the way, and therefore must be used up in some way before the next one is made. The following shows an example of a p144 gun which consists of a p144 block factory whose output is converted into gliders by a p72 oscillator.

This gun is David Bell's improvement of the one Bill Gosper found in July 1994. The p72 oscillator is by Robert Wainwright in 1990, and the block factory is Achim's p144 minus one of its stabilizing blocks. For a block factory using stable components and triggered by an input Herschel, see also keeper.
:familiar fours Common patterns of four identical objects. The five commonest are traffic light (4 blinkers), honey farm (4 beehives), blockade (4 blocks), fleet (4 ships, although really 2 ship-ties) and bakery (4 loaves, although really 2 bi-loaves). Also sometimes included is four skewed blocks.

:fanout A mechanism that emits two or more objects of some type for each one that it receives. Typically the objects are gliders or Herschels; glider duplicators are a special case.

:Fast Forward Force Field The following reaction found by Dieter Leithner in May 1994. In the absence of the incoming LWSS the gliders would simply annihilate one another, but as shown they allow the LWSS to advance 11 spaces in the course of the next 6 generations.

The illusion of super-light-speed travel is caused by an LWSS that is always created, but is then destroyed in some cases, by a signal catching up to it from behind that necessarily never travels faster than the speed of light. It is not possible to make any use of the apparent super-light-speed signal. The front end of an output LWSS can't be distinguished from the alternative dying spark output until several more ticks have passed. Not surprisingly, this extra time is enough to drop the average speed of information transmission safely below c.

Leithner named the Fast Forward Force Field in honour of his favourite science fiction writer, the physicist Robert L. Forward. See also star gate and speed booster.

:fate The result of evolving a pattern until its final behaviour is known. This answers such questions such as whether or not the pattern remains finite, what its growth rate is, what period the final state may settle into, and what its final census is. All small Life objects seem to eventually settle down into a mix of oscillators, simple spaceships, and occasionally small puffers. See methuselah, soup, ash.

Most sufficiently large random patterns are expected to grow forever due to the production of switch engines at their boundary. Engineered Life objects - and therefore also sufficiently large and unlikely random patterns - can have more interesting behaviour, such as breeders, sawtooths, and prime calculators. Some objects have even been constructed or designed having an unknown fate.

:father = parent

:fd Abbreviation for full diagonals.

:featherweight spaceship = glider

:fencepost Any pattern that stabilizes one end of a wick.

:Fermat prime calculator A pattern constructed by Jason Summers in January 2000 that exhibits infinite growth if and only if there are no Fermat primes greater than 65537. The question of whether or not it really does exhibit infinite growth is therefore equivalent to a well-known and long-standing unsolved mathematical problem. It will, however, still be growing at generation 102585827975. The pattern is based on Dean Hickerson's primer and caber tosser patterns and a p8 beehive puffer by Hartmut Holzwart.

:filter Any oscillator used to delete some but not all of the spaceships in a stream. An example is the blocker, which can be positioned so as to delete every other glider in a stream of period 8n+4, and can also do the same for LWSS streams. Other examples are the MW emulator and T-nosed p4 (either of which can be used to delete every other LWSS in a stream of period 4n+2), the fountain (which does the same for MWSS streams) and a number of others, such as the p6 pipsquirter, the pentadecathlon and the p72 oscillator shown under factory. Another example, a p4 oscillator deleting every other HWSS in a stream of period 4n+2, is shown below. (The p4 oscillator here was found, with a slightly larger stator, by Dean Hickerson in November 1994.)

:filter stream A stream of spaceships in which there are periodic gaps in the stream. This can thin out another crossing stream by deleting the spaceships in the second stream except where the gaps occur. The filter stream is not affected by the deletions so that the same stream can thin out multiple other streams. The Caterpillar uses filter streams of MWSSs in which there is a gap every 6 spaceships. Here is part of a filter stream that thins a glider stream by 2/3:

:finger A protruding cell in an oscillator or dying spark, with the ability to modify a nearby active reaction. Like a thumb, a finger cell appears at the edge of a reaction envelope and is the only live cell in its row or column. The finger spark remains alive for two ticks before dying, whereas a thumb cell dies after one tick. Because the key cell is kept alive for an extra tick, an alternate technical term is "held (orthogonal) bit spark". A "held diagonal bit spark" is not possible in B3/S23 for obvious reasons.

:fire An encoded signal used in combination with push and pull elbow operations in a simple construction arm. When a FIRE signal is sent, the construction-arm elbow produces an output glider, usually at 90 degrees from the construction arm. This terminology is generally used when there is only a single recipe for such a glider output, or only one recipe for each glider colour (e.g., FIRE WHITE, FIRE BLACK).

:fireship (c/10 orthogonally, p10) A variant of the copperhead with a trailing component that emits several large sparks, discovered by Simon Ekström on 20 March 2016. The interaction between the copperhead and the additional component is minimal enough that the extension technically fits the definition of a tagalong. However, the extension slightly modifies two of the phases of the spaceship, starting two ticks after the phase shown below, so it's also valid to classify the fireship as a distinct spaceship.

:flip-flop Any p2 oscillator. However, the term is also used in two more specific (and non-equivalent) senses: (a) any p2 oscillator whose two phases are mirror images of one another, and (b) any p2 oscillator in which all rotor cells die from underpopulation. In the latter sense it contrasts with on-off. The term has also been used even more specifically for the 12-cell flip-flop shown under phoenix.

:flip-flops Another name for the flip-flop shown under phoenix.

:flipper Any oscillator or spaceship that forms its mirror image halfway through its period.

:flotilla A spaceship composed of a number of smaller interacting spaceships. Often one or more of these is not a true spaceship and could not survive without the support of the others. The following example shows an OWSS escorted by two HWSS.

:fly-by deletion A reaction performed by a passing convoy of spaceships which deletes a common stationary object without harming the convoy. Fly-by deletion is often used in the construction of puffers and spaceships to clean up unwanted debris.

For c/2 convoys this is not usually difficult since the LWSS, MWSS, and HWSS spaceships have such useful sparks. However, some objects are more difficult to delete. For example, deleting a tub appears to require an unusual p4 spaceship.

The deletion of a pond appears to require a convoy which is 89 cells in width containing a very unusual p4 spaceship which has 273 cells. There are small objects which have no known fly-by deletion reactions. However, as in the case of reanimation, hitting them with the output of rakes is an effective brute force method.

:freeze-dried A term used for a glider constructible seed that can activated in some way to produce a complex object. For example, a "freeze-dried salvo" is a constellation of constructible objects which, when triggered by a single glider, produces a unidirectional glider salvo, and nothing else. Freeze-dried salvos can be useful in slow salvo constructions, especially when an active circuit has to destroy or reconstruct itself in a limited amount of time. Gradual modification by a construction arm may be too slow, or the circuit doing the construction may itself be the object that must be modified.

The concept may be applied to other types of objects. For example, one possible way to build a gun for a waterbear would be to program a construction arm to build a freeze-dried waterbear seed, and then trigger it when the construction is complete.

:frothing puffer A frothing puffer (or a frothing spaceship) is a puffer (or spaceship) whose back end appears to be unstable and breaking apart, but which nonetheless survives. The exhaust festers and clings to the back of the puffer/spaceship before breaking off. The first known frothing puffers were c/2, and most were found by slightly modifying the back ends of p2 spaceships. A number of these have periods which are not a multiple of 4 (as with some line puffers). Paul Tooke has also found c/3 frothing puffers.

The following p78 c/2 frothing puffer was found by Paul Tooke in April 2001.

:fuse A wick burning at one end. For examples, see baker, beacon maker, blinker ship, boat maker, cow, harvester, lightspeed wire, pi ship, reverse fuse, superstring and washerwoman. Useful fuses are usually clean, but see also reburnable fuse.

A fuse can burn arbitrarily slowly, as demonstrated by the example Blockic fuse below. A signal, alternating between glider and MWSS form, travels up and down between two rows of blocks in a series of one-time turner reactions. The spacing shown here causes the fuse to burn 24 cells to the right every 240 generations, for a speed of c/10. Moving the bottom half further from the top half by any even number of cells will slow down the burning even further.

:Fx119 An elementary conduit, one of the original sixteen Herschel conduits, discovered by Dave Buckingham in September 1996. After 119 ticks, it produces an inverted Herschel at (20, 14) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 231 ticks; this can be reduced somewhat by suppressing the output Herschel's glider, or by adding extra catalysts to make the reaction settle more quickly. A ghost Herschel in the pattern below marks the output location:

This edge shooter has an unusually high 27hd clearance, one of the highest known for a single small component. The only known higher-clearance edge shooters are injectors making use of multiple interacting spaceships. This makes the Fx119 inserter ideal for the construction of wide convoys whose total width can fit within its clearance distance.

The component creates a large cloud of smoke behind its emitted glider which lasts for over 90 generations. In spite of this, many tightly packed convoys can be made by injecting later gliders behind others in the convoy, helped along by the insertion reaction which is able to catch up to the existing gliders. The Fx119 inserter can place a glider on the same lane as a passing glider and as close as 15 ticks behind, which is only one step away from the minimum possible following distance.

:Fx153 A composite conduit, one of the original sixteen Herschel conduits, discovered by Paul Callahan in February 1997. It is made up of two elementary conduits, HF94B + BFx59H. After 153 ticks, it produces an inverted Herschel at (48, -4) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 69 ticks.

After 176 ticks, it produces an inverted Herschel at (45, 0) relative to the input. The recovery time of the standard form shown here is 92 ticks, but see the PF35W entry for a variant discovered in November 2017 that lowers the repeat time to 73 ticks.

:Fx77 An elementary conduit, one of the original sixteen Herschel conduits, discovered by Dave Buckingham in August 1996. After 77 ticks, it produces an inverted Herschel at (25, -8) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 61 ticks; this can be reduced slightly by suppressing the output Herschel's glider, as in the L112 case. A pipsquirter can replace the blinker-suppressing eater to produce an extra glider output. It is one of the simplest known Spartan conduits, and one of the few elementary conduits in the original set of sixteen.

In January 2016, Tanner Jacobi discovered a Spartan method of extracting an extra glider output (top variant below). A ghost Herschel marks the output location for each variant.

:Garden of Eden A configuration of ON and OFF cells that can only occur in generation 0. (This term was first used in connection with cellular automata by John W. Tukey, many years before Life.) It was known from the start that there are Gardens of Eden in Life, because of a theorem by Edward Moore that guarantees their existence in a wide class of cellular automata. Explicit examples have since been constructed, the first by Roger Banks, et al. at MIT in 1971. This example was 9 × 33. In 1974 J. Hardouin-Duparc et al. at the University of Bordeaux 1 produced a 6 × 122 example. The following shows a 12 × 12 example found by Nicolay Beluchenko in February 2006, based on a 13 × 12 one found by Achim Flammenkamp in June 2004.

An exhaustive search of 90-degree rotationally symmetric 10×10 patterns was possible because the symmetry reduces the number of unknown cells by a factor of four.

:Gemini ((5120,1024)c/33699586 obliquely, p33699586) The first self-constructing spaceship, and also the first oblique spaceship. It was made public by Andrew Wade on 18 May 2010. It was the thirteenth explicitly constructed spaceship velocity in Life, and made possible an infinite family of related velocities. The Gemini spaceship derives its name from the Latin "gemini", meaning twins, describing its two identical halves, each of which contains three Chapman-Greene construction arms. A tape of gliders continually relays between the two halves, instructing each to delete its parent and construct a daughter configuration.

:Gemini puffer See Pianola breeder.

:Geminoid A type of self-constructing circuitry that borrows key ideas from Andrew Wade's Gemini spaceship, but with several simplifications. The main feature common to the Gemini spaceship is the construction recipe encoding method. Information is stored directly, and much more efficiently, in the timings of moving gliders, rather than in a static tape with 1s and 0s encoded by the presence of small stationary objects.

Unlike the original Gemini, Geminoids have ambidextrous construction arms, initially using glider pairs on two lanes separated by 9hd, 10hd, or 0hd. The design was the basis for the linear propagator and the Demonoids. A more recent development is a Geminoid toolkit using a single-channel construction arm, which allows for the possibility of multiple elbows with no loss of efficiency, or the construction of temporary lossless elbows. Compare slow elbow.

Other new developments that could be considered part of the extended "Geminoid" toolkit include freeze-dried construction salvos and seeds, used when objects must be built within a short time window, and self-destruct circuits, which are used as an alternative to a destructor arm to clean up temporary objects in a similarly short window.

:ghost Herschel A dying spark made by removing one cell from the Herschel heptomino.

:GIG A glider injection gate. This is a device for injecting a glider into a glider stream. The injected glider is synthesized from one or more incoming spaceships assisted by the presence of the GIG. (This contrasts with some other glider injection reactions which do not require a GIG, as in inject.) Gliders already in the glider stream pass through the GIG without interfering with it. A GIG usually consists of a small number of oscillators.

For example, in July 1996 Dieter Leithner found the following reaction which allows the construction of a pseudo-period 14 glider stream. It uses two LWSS streams, a pentadecathlon and a volcano.

:glider (c/4 diagonally, p4) The smallest, most common and first discovered spaceship. This was found by Richard Guy in 1970 while Conway's group was attempting to track the evolution of the R-pentomino. The name is due in part to the fact that it is glide symmetric. (It is often stated that Conway discovered the glider, but he himself has said it was Guy. See also the cryptic reference ("some guy") in Winning Ways.)

:glider-block cycle An infinite oscillator based on the following reaction (a variant of the rephaser). The oscillator consists of copies of this reaction displaced 2n spaces from one another (for some n>6) with blocks added between the copies in order to cause the reaction to occur again halfway through the period. The period of the resulting infinite oscillator is 8n-20. (Alternatively, in a cylindrical universe of width 2n the oscillator just consists of two gliders and two blocks.)

:glider duplicator Any reaction in which one input glider is converted into two output gliders. This can be done by oscillators or spaceships, or by Herschel conduits or other signal circuitry such as the stable example shown under splitter. The most useful glider duplicators are those with low periods.

The following period 30 glider duplicator demonstrates a simple mechanism found by Dieter Leithner. The input glider stream comes in from the upper left, and the output glider streams leave at the upper and lower right. One of the output glider streams is inverted, so an inverting reflector is required to complete the duplicator. To produce non-parallel output, an inline inverter could be substituted for the northmost p30 glider gun.

Spaceship convoys that can duplicate gliders are very useful since they (along with glider turners) provide a means to clean up many dirty puffers by duplicating and turning output gliders so as to impact into the exhaust to clean it up.

Glider duplicators and turners are known for backward gliders using p2 c/2 spaceships, and for forward gliders using p3 c/3 spaceships. These are the most general duplicators for these speeds.

:glider gun A gun that fires gliders. For examples, see Gosper glider gun, Simkin glider gun, new gun, p45 gun.

True-period glider guns are known for some low periods, and for all periods over 53 using Herschel conduit technology. See true for a list of known true-period guns. The lowest true-period gun possible is the p14 gun since that is the lowest possible period for any glider stream, but no example has yet been found.

Pseudo-period glider guns are known for every period above 13. These are made by using multiple true-period guns of some multiple of the period, and glider injection methods to fill in the gaps.

:glider injection gate = GIG

:glider lane See lane.

:gliderless A gun is said to be gliderless if it does not use gliders. The purist definition would insist that a glider does not appear anywhere, even incidentally. For a long time the only known way to construct LWSS, MWSS and HWSS guns involved gliders, and it was not until April 1996 that Dieter Leithner constructed the first gliderless gun (a p46 LWSS gun).

In October 2017 Matthias Merzenich used two copies of Tanner's p46 to create a p46 MWSS gun. This is the smallest known gliderless gun, and also the smallest known MWSS gun.

:glider pair Two gliders travelling in the same direction with a specific spacetime offset. In a transceiver the preferred term is tandem glider. For several years, glider pairs on lanes separated by 9 or 10 half diagonals were the standard building blocks in Geminoid construction arm recipes. In more recent 0hd and single-channel construction toolkits, all gliders share the same lane, but glider pairs and singletons are still important concepts.

:glider-producing switch engine See stabilized switch engine.

:glider pusher An arrangement of a queen bee shuttle and a pentadecathlon that can push the path of a passing glider out by one half-diagonal space. This was found by Dieter Leithner in December 1993 and is shown below. It is useful for constructing complex guns where it may be necessary to produce a number of gliders travelling on close parallel paths. See also edge shooter.

:glider stopper A Spartan logic circuit discovered by Paul Callahan in 1996. It allows a glider signal to pass through the circuit, leaving behind a beehive that can cleanly absorb a single glider from a perpendicular glider stream. Two optional glider outputs are also shown. The circuit can't be re-used until the beehive "bit" is cleared by the passage of at least one perpendicular input. A similar mechanism discovered more recently is shown in the beehive stopper entry.

:glider synthesis Construction of an object by means of glider collisions. It is generally assumed that the gliders should be arranged so that they could come from infinity. That is, gliders should not have had to pass through one another to achieve the initial arrangement.

Glider syntheses for all still lifes and known oscillators with at most 14 cells were found by Dave Buckingham. As of June 2018, this limit has been increased to 18 cells.

Perhaps the most interesting glider syntheses are those of spaceships, because these can be used to create corresponding guns and rakes. Many of the c/2 spaceships that are based on standard spaceships have been synthesized, mostly by Mark Niemiec. In June 1998 Stephen Silver found syntheses for some of the Corderships (although it was not until July 1999 that Jason Summers used this to build a Cordership gun). In May 2000, Noam Elkies suggested that a 2c/5 spaceship found by Tim Coe in May 1996 might be a candidate for glider synthesis. Initial attempts to construct a synthesis for this spaceship got fairly close, but it was only in March 2003 that Summers and Elkies managed to find a way to perform the crucial last step. Summers then used the new synthesis to build a c/2 forward rake for the 2c/5 spaceship; this was the first example in Life of a rake which fires spaceships that travel in the same direction as the rake but more slowly.

A 3-glider synthesis of a pentadecathlon is shown in the diagram below. This was found in April 1997 by Heinrich Koenig and came as a surprise, as it was widely assumed that anything using just three gliders would already be known.

:glider turner Any reaction in which a glider is turned onto a new path by a spaceship, oscillator, or still life constellation. In the last two cases, the glider turner is usually called a reflector if the reaction is repeatable, or a one-time turner if the reaction can only happen once.

Glider turners are easily built using standard spaceships. The following diagram shows a convoy which turns a forward glider 90 degrees, with the new glider also moving forwards.

:Gosper glider gun The first known gun, and indeed the first known finite pattern displaying infinite growth, found by Bill Gosper in November 1970. This period 30 gun remains the smallest known gun in terms of its bounding box, though some variants of the p120 Simkin glider gun have a lower population. Gosper later constructed several other guns, such as new gun and the p144 gun shown under factory. See also p30 gun.

:Gotts dots A 41-cell 187×39 superlinear growth pattern found by Bill Gosper in March 2006, who named it in honour of Nick Gotts, discoverer of many other low-population superlinear patterns, such as Jaws, the mosquitoes, teeth, catacryst and metacatacryst. See switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population superlinear growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the record-holders.

Collisions within the pattern cause it to sprout its Nth switch engine at generation T = ~224n-6. The population of the pattern at time t is asymptotically proportional to t times log(t), so the growth rate is O(t ln(t)), faster than linear growth but slower than quadratic growth.

:grammar A set of rules for connecting components together to make an object such as a spaceship, oscillator or still life. For example, in August 1989 Dean Hickerson found a grammar for constructing an infinite number of short wide c/3 period 3 spaceships, using 33 different components and a table showing the ways that they can be joined together.

:grandfather = grandparent

:grandfatherless A traditional name for a pattern with one or more parents but no grandparent. This was a hypothetical designation until May 2016. See grandparent for details.

:grandparent A pattern is said to be a grandparent of the pattern it gives rise to after two generations. For over thirty years, a well-known open problem was the question of whether any pattern existed that had a parent but no grandparent. In 1972, LifeLine Volume 6 mentioned John Conway's offer of a $50 prize for a solution to the problem, but it remained open until May 2016 when a user with the conwaylife.com forum handle 'mtve' posted an example.

Other patterns have since been found that have a grandparent but no great-grandparent, or a great-grandparent but no great-great-grandparent. Further examples in this series almost certainly exist, but as of July 2018 none have yet been found.

:half diagonal A natural measurement of distance between parallel glider lanes, or between elbow locations in a universal construction arm elbow operation library. If two gliders are in the same phase and exactly lined up vertically or horizontally, N cells away from each other, then the two glider lanes are considered to be N half diagonals (hd) apart. Gliders that are an integer number of full diagonals apart must be the same colour, whereas integer half diagonals allow for both glider colours. See colour of a glider, linear propagator.

:hashlife A Life algorithm by Bill Gosper that is designed to take advantage of the considerable amount of repetitive behaviour in many large patterns of interest. It provides a means of evolving repetitive patterns millions (or even billions or trillions) of generations further than normal Life algorithms can manage in a reasonable amount of time.

The hashlife algorithm is described by Gosper in his paper listed in the bibliography at the end of this lexicon. Roughly speaking, the idea is to store subpatterns in a hash table so that the results of their evolution do not need to be recomputed if they arise again at some other place or time in the evolution of the full pattern. This does, however, mean that complex patterns can require substantial amounts of memory.

Tomas Rokicki and Andrew Trevorrow implemented Hashlife into Golly in 2005. See also macrocell.

:heat For an oscillator or spaceship, the average number of cells which change state in each generation. For example, the heat of a glider is 4, because 2 cells are born and 2 die every generation.

For a period n oscillator with an r-cell rotor the heat is at least 2r/n and no more than r(1-(n mod 2)/n). For n=2 and n=3 these bounds are equal.

:Heisenburp device A pattern which can detect the passage of a glider without affecting the glider's path or timing. The first such device was constructed by David Bell in December 1992. The term, coined by Bill Gosper, refers to the fact that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle fails to apply in the Life universe. See also stable pseudo-Heisenburp and natural Heisenburp.

The following is an example of the kind of reaction used at the heart of a Heisenburp device. The glider at bottom right alters the reaction of the other two gliders without itself being affected in any way.

:heptomino Any 7-cell polyomino. There are 108 such objects. Those with names in common use are the B-heptomino, the Herschel and the pi-heptomino.

:Herschel (stabilizes at time 128) The following pattern which occurs at generation 20 of the B-heptomino.

	O..
	O.O
	OOO
	..O
The name is commonly ascribed to the Herschel heptomino's similarity to a planetary symbol. William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781. However, in point of fact a Herschel bears no particular resemblance to either of the symbols used for Uranus, but does closely resemble the symbol for Saturn. So the appropriate name might actually be "Huygens", but "Herschel" is now universally used by tradition.

Herschels are one of the most versatile types of signal in stable circuitry. R-pentominoes and B-heptominoes naturally evolve into Herschels, and converters have also been found that change pi-heptominoes and several other signal types into Herschels, and vice versa. See elementary conduit.

:Herschel circuit A series of Herschel conduits or other components, connected by placing them so that the output Herschels from early conduits become the input Herschels for later conduits. Often the initial component is a converter accepting some other signal type as input - usually a glider, in which case a syringe is most commonly used. The Silver reflector is a well-known early Spartan Herschel circuit from before the syringe was discovered, where the initial converter is a Callahan G-to-H.

Sometimes a direct connection between two conduits is not possible due to unwanted gliders that destroy required catalysts, or wanted gliders that are not able to escape. In this case, small "spacer" conduits such as F116, F117, Fx77, R64, L112, or L156 can be inserted between the other conduits to solve the problem.

Some converter or factory conduits do not produce a Herschel as output, instead generating other useful results such as gliders, boats or MWSSes. See Herschel-to-glider, demultiplexer, and H-to-MWSS respectively for examples of these. For those conduits which do produce an unwanted Herschel, an eater such as SW-2 can be added to delete it.

If the first and last conduits of a chain connect to each other in a loop then there is no need for a syringe to generate the first Herschel, or an eater to consume the last one. The circuit becomes a self-supporting Herschel loop. A loop is also formed by a syringe connected to a Herschel-to-glider converter, with the glider reflected back to the syringe's input with glider reflectors of the appropriate colour, usually Snarks. In either case, if the loop has a surplus glider output, it becomes a gun; if no output is available it is an emu.

:Herschel climber Any reburnable fuse reaction involving Herschels. May refer specifically to the (23,5)c/79 Herschel climber used in the waterbear, or one of several similar reactions with various velocities. See also Herschel-pair climber.

:Herschel component = Herschel conduit

:Herschel conduit A conduit that moves a Herschel from one place to another. See also Herschel loop.

Well over a hundred simple stable Herschel conduits are currently known. As of June 2018 the number is approximately 150, depending on the precise definition of "simple" - e.g., fitting inside a 100×100 bounding box, and producing output in no more than 300 ticks. In general a Herschel conduit can be called "simple" if its active reaction does not return to a Herschel stage except at its output. Compare elementary conduit, composite conduit. A description of common usage in complex circuitry, using syringes and Snarks to make compact connections, can be found in Herschel circuit.

The original universal set consisted of sixteen stable Herschel conduits, discovered between 1995 and 1998 by Dave Buckingham (DJB) and Paul Callahan (PBC). These are shown in the following table. In this table, the number in "name/steps" is the number of ticks needed to produce an output Herschel from the input Herschel. "m" tells how the Herschel is moved (R = turned right, L = turned left, B = turned back, F = unturned, f = flipped), and "dx" and "dy" give the displacement of the centre cell of the Herschel (assumed to start in the orientation shown above).

:Herschel descendant A common active pattern occurring at generation 22 of a Herschel's evolution:

	OO..
	O.OO
	...O
	.O.O
	.OO.
There are other evolutionary paths leading to the same pattern, including the modification of a B-heptomino implied by generation 21 of a Herschel.
:Herschel great-grandparent A specific three-tick predecessor of a Herschel, commonly seen in Herschel conduit collections that contain dependent conduits. In some situations it is helpful to display the input reaction in this form instead of the standard Herschel form.

	.OO....
	OOO.OO.
	.OO.OOO
	OOO.OO.
	OO.....
Dependent conduit inputs are catalysed by a transparent block before the Herschel's standard form can appear, and before the Herschel's first natural glider is produced. This means that these conduits will fail if an actual Herschel is placed in the "correct" input location for a dependent conduit. Refer to F166 or Lx200 to see the correct relative placement of the standard transparent block catalyst.

Almost all known Herschel conduits produce a Herschel great-grandparent near the end of their evolutionary sequence. In the original universal set of Herschel conduits, Fx158 is the only exception.

:Herschel loop A cyclic Herschel track. Although no loop of length less than 120 generations has been constructed it is possible to make oscillators of smaller periods by putting more than one Herschel in a higher-period track. In this way oscillators, and in most cases guns, of all periods from 54 onwards can now be constructed (although the p55 case is a bit strange, shooting itself with gliders in order to stabilize itself). A mechanism for a period-52 loop was found in April 2018, but it includes a stage where the signal is carried by a triplet of gliders so it may not be considered to be a pure Herschel loop. The missing period, 53, is a difficult case simply because 53 is prime and so no small sparkers or reflectors are available.

See Simkin glider gun and p256 gun for the smallest known Herschel loops. See also emu and omniperiodic.

:Herschel-pair climber Any reburnable fuse reaction involving pairs of Herschels. May refer specifically to the 31c/240 Herschel-pair climber used in the Centipede, or one of several similar reactions with various velocities. See also Herschel climber.

:Herschel receiver Any circuit that converts a tandem glider into a Herschel signal. The following diagram shows a pattern found by Paul Callahan in 1996, as part of the first stable glider reflector. Used as a receiver, it converts two parallel input gliders (with path separations of 2, 5, or 6) to an R-pentomino. The signal is then converted to a Herschel by one of several known mechanisms, the first of which was found by Dave Buckingham way back in 1972. The second is elementary conduit RF48H, found by Stephen Silver in October 1997. The receiver version shown below uses Buckingham's R-to-Herschel converter, which is made up of elementary conduit RF28B followed by BFx59H.

:Herschel stopper A method of cleanly suppressing a Herschel signal with an asynchronous boat-bit, discovered by Dean Hickerson. Here a ghost Herschel marks the location of the output signal, in cases where the boat-bit is not present. Other boat-bit locations that allow for clean suppression of a Herschel are also known.

This term is also sometimes used to refer to any mechanism that cleanly suppresses a Herschel. These usually allow the Herschel's first natural glider to escape, so they are more commonly classified as converters. See SW-2.

:Herschel-to-glider The largest category of elementary conduit. Gliders are very common and self-supporting, so it's much easier to find these than any other type of output signal. A large collection of these H-to-G converters has been compiled, with many different output lanes and timings. These can be used to synchronize multiple signals to produce gun patterns or complex logic circuitry. See NW31T120 for an example.

:Herschel track A track for Herschels. An equivalent term is Herschel circuit. See also B track.

:Herschel transceiver An adjustable Herschel conduit made up of a Herschel transmitter and a Herschel receiver. The intermediate stage consists of a tandem glider - two gliders on parallel lanes - so that the transmitter and receiver can be separated by any required distance. The conduit may be stable, or may contain low-period oscillators.

:Herschel transmitter Any Herschel-to-two-glider converter that produces a tandem glider that can be used as input to a Herschel receiver. If the gliders are far enough apart, and if one of the gliders is used only for cleanup, then the transmitter is ambidextrous: with a small modification to the receiver, a suitably oriented mirror image of the receiver will also work.

The following diagram shows a stable Herschel transmitter found by Paul Callahan in May 1997:

:high-bandwidth telegraph (p960, p30 circuitry) A variant of the telegraph constructed by Louis-François Handfield in February 2017, using periodic components to achieve a transmission rate of one bit per 192 ticks. The same ten signals are sent as in the original telegraph and the p1 telegraph, but information is encoded more efficiently in the timing of those signals. Specifically, the new transmitter sends five bits every 960 ticks by adjusting the relative timings inside each of the five mirror-image paired subunits of the composite signal in the beehive-chain lightspeed wire fuse.

:high-clearance See clearance.

:highway robber Any mechanism that can retrieve a signal from a spaceship lane while allowing spaceships on nearby lanes to pass by unaffected. In practice the spaceship is generally a glider. The signal is removed from the lane, an output signal is generated elsewhere, and the highway robber returns to its original state. A competent highway robber does not affect gliders even on the lane adjacent to the affected glider stream, except during its recovery period.

A perfect highway robber doesn't affect later gliders even in the lane to which it is attached, even during its recovery period. Below is a near-perfect highway robber "bait" that requires three synchronized signals to rebuild (the Herschel, B-heptomino, and glider.) The glider at the top right passes by unharmed, but another glider following on the same lane 200 ticks later will be cleanly reflected to a new path, and another glider following that one will also pass by unharmed. The only imperfection is a few ticks at the very end of the reconstruction, as the beehive is being rebuilt:

:hive = beehive

:hivenudger (c/2 orthogonally, p4) A spaceship found by Hartmut Holzwart in July 1992. (The name is due to Bill Gosper.) It consists of a pre-beehive escorted by four LWSS. In fact any LWSS can be replaced by a MWSS or an HWSS, so that there are 45 different single-hive hivenudgers.

:honey bit A block and pond constellation used in the OTCA metapixel by Brice Due in 2006, to store and retrieve a bit of data - specifically, the presence or absence of a neighbor metacell. The "0" state of the honey bit memory unit is a simple beehive, which is also the source of the name.

An input glider collides with the beehive to convert it into the honey bit constellation, which can be thought of as a value of "1" stored in the memory unit. A passing LWSS can then test for the presence of the pond. If a collision occurs, the LWSS and the honey bit constellation are mutually annihilated, leaving just the original beehive. Below is the honeybit constellation with the two reactions occurring in the opposite order - test, then reset.

If the pond is not present, the LWSS passes by the beehive without affecting it. Thus a test input has an output for the "0" case, but not for the "1" case. For an alternative memory-unit mechanism with both "0" and "1" outputs, see demultiplexer.
The honey bit is also an interesting eater for the HWSS as shown below. An HWSS colliding with the pond happens to create the exact same reset glider used in the above memory unit.

:H-to-G A Herschel-to-glider converter.

:H-to-MWSS A Spartan converter found by Tanner Jacobi in October 2015, which converts an input Herschel to a middleweight spaceship. The key discovery was a very small but slightly dirty H-to-MWSS conduit, where a Herschel is catalyzed to produce an MWSS but also leaves behind a beehive. Prefixing two R64 conduits to this produces a composite converter that successfully deletes the beehive in advance, using the input Herschel's first natural glider.

:IMG = intermitting glider gun

:Immigration A form of colourised Life in which there are two types of ON cell, a newly-born cell taking the type of the majority of its three parent cells and surviving cells remaining of the same type as in the previous generation.

:independent conduit A Herschel conduit in which the input Herschel produces its first natural glider. Compare dependent conduit.

:induction coil Any object used to stabilize an edge (or edges) without touching. The tubs used in the Gray counter are examples, as are the blocks and snakes used in the Hertz oscillator and the heptomino at the bottom of the mathematician.

:inductor Any oscillator with a row of dead cells down the middle and whose two halves are mirror images of one another, both halves being required for the oscillator to work. The classic examples are the pulsar and the tumbler. If still lifes are considered as p1 oscillators then there are numerous simple examples that include this kind of central gutter, such as table on table, dead spark coil and cis-mirrored R-bee. Some spaceships, such as the brain, the snail and the spider, use the same principle.

:infinite glider hotel A pattern by David Bell, named after Hilbert's "infinite hotel" scenario in which a hotel with an infinite number of rooms has room for more guests even if it is already full, simply by shuffling the old guests around.

In this pattern, two pairs of Corderships moving at c/12 are pulling apart such that there is an ever-lengthening glider track between them. Every 128 generations another glider is injected into the glider track (see LWSS-glider bounce), joining the gliders already circulating there. The number of gliders in the track therefore increases without limit.

The tricky part of this construction is that even though all the previously injected gliders are repeatedly flying through the injection point, that point is guaranteed to be empty when it is time for the next glider to be injected.

:infinite growth Growth of a finite pattern such that the population tends to infinity, or at least is unbounded. Sometimes the term is used for growth of something other than population (for example, length), but here we will only consider infinite population growth. The first known pattern with infinite growth in this sense was the Gosper glider gun, created in a response to a $50 prize challenge by John Conway. Martin Gardner's October 1970 article described the challenge as "Conway conjectures that no pattern can grow without limit", but Conway later explained that he had always expected that this would be disproved. The original purpose in investigating CA rules including B3/S23 was to show that a very simple two-state rule could support a universal computer and/or universal constructor. If all finite patterns could be proven to be bounded, neither of these would be possible.

An interesting question is: What is the minimum population of a pattern that exhibits infinite growth? In 1971 Charles Corderman found that a switch engine could be stabilized by a pre-block in a number of different ways, giving 11-cell patterns with infinite growth. This record stood for more than quarter of a century until Paul Callahan found, in November 1997, two 10-cell patterns with infinite growth. The following month he found the one shown below, which is much neater, being a single cluster. This produces a stabilized switch engine of the block-laying type.

	......O.
	....O.OO
	....O.O.
	....O...
	..O.....
	O.O.....
Nick Gotts and Paul Callahan showed in October 1997 that there is no infinite growth pattern with fewer than 10 cells, so that question has now been answered.
In October 2014, Michael Simkin discovered a three-glider collision that produces a glider-producing stabilized switch engine and thus produces infinite growth from the smallest possible number of gliders (since all 71 2-glider collisions have a finite limit population).

Also of interest is the following pattern (again found by Callahan), which is the only 5×5 pattern with infinite growth. This too emits a block-laying switch engine.

	OOO.O
	O....

Following a conjecture of Nick Gotts, Stephen Silver produced, in May 1998, a pattern of width 1 which exhibits infinite growth. This pattern was very large (12470×1 in the first version, reduced to 5447×1 the following day). In October 1998 Paul Callahan did an exhaustive search, finding the smallest example, the 39×1 pattern shown below. This produces two block-laying switch engines, stability being achieved at generation 1483.

Larger patterns have since been constructed that display quadratic growth.
Although the simplest infinite growth patterns grow at a rate that is (asymptotically) linear, many other types of growth rate are possible, quadratic growth (see also breeder) being the fastest. Dean Hickerson has found many patterns with unusual growth rates, such as sawtooths and a caber tosser. Another pattern with superlinear but non-quadratic growth is Gotts dots.

:inject A reaction in which a hole in a regular spaceship stream is filled partially or fully by adding a new spaceship of the same type without affecting the existing spaceships in the stream. Depending on the period of the stream, different mechanisms can be used. For adding a spaceship to an existing multi-lane convoy, see inserter.

For large period glider streams, simple reactions such as LWSS-LWSS bounce and LWSS-glider bounce suffice. If Herschel technology is used, a large number of edge shooters and transparent conduits are known. Simple examples include the NW31 Herschel-to-glider converter and the Fx119 inserter.

Shown below is an injector found by Dave Buckingham that can fill a hole in a p15 glider stream:

For very low-period glider streams, a GIG is a much more efficient insertion method, in the sense that fewer synchronized signals are needed. However, it has been shown that colliding gliders can complete an insertion even into a single-glider gap in a period-14 stream.
:inline inverter The following reaction in which a p30 gun can be used to invert the presence or absence of gliders in a p30 stream, with the output glider stream being in the same direction as the input glider stream.

:intermediate target A temporary product of a partial slow salvo, elbow operation, or glider synthesis. An intermediate target is a useful step toward a desired outcome, but will not appear in the final construction.

:intermittent stream A stream of spaceships which is based on a periodic stream, but which can contain holes where some of the spaceships are not present. There is a base period for the intermittent stream such that if a spaceship arrives at a specific location, then it always does so at a generation which is a multiple of the base period. For example, the output from a period 30 glider gun where every third glider is deleted is an intermittent stream. A pseudo-random glider generator can produce a complicated intermittent stream with no obvious pattern.

Intermittent streams can be used to transmit signals, where holes in the stream can also convey information. For example, the stream can be processed by an inverter having the same period.

:intermitting glider gun Despite the name, an intermitting glider gun (IMG) is more often an oscillator than a gun. There are two basic types. A type 1 IMG consists of two guns firing at one another in such a way that each gun is temporarily disabled on being hit by a glider from the other gun. A type 2 IMG consists of a single gun firing at a 180-degree glider reflector in such a way that returning gliders temporarily disable the gun.

Both types of IMG can be used to make glider guns of periods that are multiples of the base period. This is done by firing another gun across the two-way intermittent stream of gliders in the IMG in such a way that gliders only occasionally escape.

:inverter A device which can be used to invert the presence or absence of spaceships in an intermittent stream of spaceships. The device must be a gun whose period matches the base period of the stream, since if there are no input spaceships then the device must produce spaceships as the result of the inversion. Typically the spaceships are gliders, and the inverter is made from a glider gun. Inverters provide a way to produce a NOT logic operation on a stream.

There are several ways to produce an inverter. The simplest method is to simply hit the output of a gun with the input stream to delete its spaceships, producing an output stream that is always turned 90 degrees from the input stream. An example is the northernmost p30 gun in the glider duplicator example pattern. For one way to produce an inverted output stream which is not turned, see inline inverter.

:inverting reflector See inverter.

:island The individual polyplets of which a stable pattern consists are sometimes called islands. So, for example, a boat has only one island, while an aircraft carrier has two, a honey farm has four and the standard form of the eater3 has five.

:Jaws A breeder constructed by Nick Gotts in February 1997. In the original version Jaws had an initial population of 150, which at the time was the smallest for any known pattern with superlinear growth. In November 1997 Gotts produced a 130-cell Jaws using some switch engine predecessors found by Paul Callahan. See switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population superlinear growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the record-holders.

Jaws consists of eight pairs of switch engines which produce a new block-laying switch engine (plus masses of junk) every 10752 generations. It is therefore an MMS breeder.

:keeper A type of factory circuit that always results in the presence of an object in the output location, whether or not the object was previously present. In many cases it is easy to construct examples by connecting multiple circuits to shoot down an object with a glider, then rebuild the object again later. The smallest keeper circuits accomplish the same thing more directly with a lucky preliminary spark from the active reaction, which removes the existing object (if any) just before the construction occurs. Below is a useful block keeper with a Herschel input.

:Klein bottle As an alternative to a torus, it's possible to make a finite Life universe in the form of a Klein bottle. The simplest way to do this is to use an m × n rectangle with the top edge joined to the bottom edge (as for a torus) and the left edge twisted and joined to the right.

:knightship Any spaceship of type (2m,m)/n - that is, a spaceship of any speed that moves obliquely in a (2,1) direction. The first Conway's Life knightship was a variant of Andrew Wade's Gemini spaceship, constructed in May 2010. The next was an even slower knightship based on the half-bakery reaction.

A knightship must be asymmetric and its period must be at least 6. This is barely within the range of current search programs, as proven by the discovery on March 6, 2018 of an elementary knightship, Sir Robin, by Adam P. Goucher and Tomas Rokicki.

By analogy with the corresponding fairy chess pieces, spaceships of types (3m,m)/n, (3m,2m)/n and (4m,m)/n would presumably be called camelships, zebraships and giraffeships, respectively. Such spaceships do exist (see universal constructor) but small elementary versions are even more difficult to search for. Any of these ship types could be constructed by trivially modifying a Gemini spaceship, or less trivially by reprogramming one of the more recent small Geminoid construction arms, but as of July 2018 a camelship Gemini is the only example that has been explicitly built.

Alternatively, the term "knightship" is regularly used to refer to any oblique spaceship, such as the original Gemini or the waterbear.

	:L112 A composite conduit, one of the original sixteen Herschel conduits, discovered by Dave Buckingham in July 1996. It is made up of two elementary conduits, HLx53B + BFx59H. After 112 ticks, it produces a Herschel turned 90 degrees counterclockwise at (12, -33) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 61 ticks; this can be reduced slightly by removing the output glider, either with a specialized eater (as in the original true p59 gun), or with a sparker as in most of the Quetzal guns. It can be made Spartan by replacing the aircraft carrier with an eater1. A ghost Herschel in the pattern below marks the output location:

It can be made Spartan by replacing the snake with an eater1 in one of two orientations.

:lane A path traveled by a glider, or less commonly a spaceship such as a loafer. The lane is centered on the line of symmetry (if any) of the spaceship in question. If a lane is clear, then the spaceship can travel along it without colliding or interfering with any other objects.

Diagonal lanes are often numbered consecutively, in half-diagonals (hd). Occasionally diagonal lane measurements are given in quarter-diagonals (qd), in part because diagonally symmetric spaceships have a line of symmetry 1qd away from the lines available for gliders. It's also convenient that moving a glider forward by 100qd (for example) has the same effect as evolving the same glider for 100 ticks.

:large prime oscillator Any oscillator with a relatively small bounding box whose period is a very large prime. (If the bounding-box restriction is removed, then eight gliders travelling in a four-Snark loop would provide a trivial example for any chosen prime.) The first such oscillator was built by Gabriel Nivasch in 2003. The current record holder is an oscillator constructed by Adam P. Goucher with a period that is a Mersenne prime with 13,395 digits (244497-1).

The next higher Mersenne-prime oscillator, period 286243-1, could be constructed with quadri-Snarks and semi-Snarks. It would actually be significantly smaller than the current record holder. As of June 2018 the construction of this pattern has not yet been completed.

:Life A 2-dimensional 2-state cellular automaton discovered by John Conway in 1970. The states are referred to as ON and OFF (or live and dead). The transition rule is as follows: a cell that is ON will remain ON in the next generation if and only if exactly 2 or 3 of the 8 adjacent cells are also ON, and a cell that is OFF will turn ON if and only if exactly 3 of the 8 adjacent cells are ON. (This is more succinctly stated as: "If 2 of your 8 nearest neighbours are ON, don't change. If 3 are ON, turn ON. Otherwise, turn OFF.")

The lifesrc algorithm is only useful for very small periods, as the amount of computing power required rises rapidly with increasing period. For most purposes, period 7 is the practical limit with current hardware.

Below is a small stabilized section of agar containing a sample lightspeed bubble, found by Gabriel Nivasch in August 1999. The bubble travels to the left at the speed of light, so it will eventually reach the edge of any finite patch and destroy itself and its supporting agar.

An open problem related to lightspeed bubbles was whether large extensible empty areas could be created whose length was not proportional to the width (as it must be in the above case, due to the tapering back edge).

:lightspeed wire Any wick that can burn non-destructively at the speed of light. Lightspeed wires are a type of reburnable fuse. These are potentially useful for various things, but so far the necessary mechanisms are very large and unwieldy. In October 2002, Jason Summers discovered a lightspeed reaction travelling through an orthogonal chain of beehives. Summers completed a period-1440 lightspeed telegraph based on this reaction in 2003.

A stable lightspeed transceiver mechanism using this same signal reaction, the p1 telegraph, was constructed by Adam P. Goucher in 2010; the bounding boxes of both the transmitter and receiver are over 5000 cells on a side. A more compact periodic high-bandwidth telegraph with a much improved transmission rate was completed by Louis-François Handfield in 2017.

The following diagram shows an older example of a lightspeed wire, with a small defect that travels along it at the speed of light. As of June 2018, no method has been found of creating such a defect in the upstream end of this particular stable wire, or of non-destructively detecting the arrival of the defect and repairing the wire at the downstream end.

:linear growth A growth rate proportional to T, where T is the number of ticks that a pattern has been run. Compare superlinear growth, quadratic growth.

:linear propagator A self-replicating pattern in which each copy of a pattern produces one child that is an exact copy of itself. The child pattern then blocks the parent from any further replication. An example was constructed by Dave Greene on 23 November 2013, with a construction arm using two glider lanes separated by 9hd. By some definitions, due to its limited one-dimensional growth pattern, the linear propagator is not a true replicator. Compare quadratic replicator.

:line crosser A pattern which is able to send a signal across an infinite diagonal line of live cells without destroying the line. David Bell built one in August 2006. It uses many one-shot period 44160 glider guns on both sides of the line having the proper synchronization to create the reactions shown in line-cutting reaction and line-mending reaction.

An input glider can arrive at any multiple of 44160 generations to first cut the line, then send a glider through the gap, and finally mend the line while leaving an output glider on the other side.

A line crosser whose complete mechanism is on one side of the line is theoretically possible, using single-channel construction methods for example.

:line-cutting reaction A reaction that can cut an infinite diagonal line of cells, leaving a gap with both ends sealed. Such a reaction is demonstrated below. In actual use the reaction should be spread out so that the incoming LWSSes don't conflict. See line-mending reaction for a way to mend the gap.

This reaction uses spaceships on both sides of the line which need to be synchronized to each other, for example by passing a glider through the gap to trigger the creation of the required spaceships and gliders.

No simple mechanism is known to mend the gap which lies completely on one side of the line. However, it is technically possible to use construction arm technology to push objects through the gap to build and trigger a seed for the required synchronized signals on the other side.

:line puffer A puffer which produces its output by means of an orthogonal line of cells at right angles to the direction of travel. The archetypal line puffer was found by Alan Hensel in March 1994, based on a spaceship found earlier that month by Hartmut Holzwart. The following month Holzwart found a way to make extensible c/2 line puffers, and Hensel found a much smaller stabilization the following day. But in October 1995 Tim Coe discovered that for large widths these were often unstable, although typically lasting millions of generations. In May 1996, however, Coe found a way to fix the instability. The resulting puffers appear to be completely stable and to exhibit an exponential increase in period as a function of width, although neither of these things has been proved.

Line puffers have enabled the construction of various difficult periods for c/2 spaceships and puffers, including occasionally periods which are not multiples of 4 and which would therefore be impossible to attain with the usual type of construction based on standard spaceships. (See frothing puffer for another method of constructing such periods.) In particular, the first c/2 rake with period not divisible by 4 was achieved in January 2000 when David Bell constructed a p42 backrake by means of line puffers.

See also hivenudger and puff suppressor.

:line ship A spaceship in which the front end is a linestretcher, the line being eaten by the back end.

:linestretcher A wickstretcher that stretches a single diagonal line of cells. The first example was constructed by Jason Summers in March 1999; this was c/12 and used switch engine based puffers found earlier by Dean Hickerson. The first c/4 example was found by Hartmut Holzwart in November 2004.

:logarithmic growth A pattern whose population or bounding box grows no faster than logarithmically, asymptotic to n.log(t) for some constant n. The first such pattern constructed was the caber tosser whose population is logarithmic, but whose bounding box still grows linearly. The first pattern whose bounding box and population both grow logarithmically was constructed by Jason Summers with Gabriel Nivasch in 2003. For a pattern with a slower growth rate than this, see Osqrtlogt.

:lossless elbow A stationary elbow in a construction arm toolkit that allows a recipe to turn a corner with no exponential increase in construction cost. Compare slow elbow. It is theoretically possible to construct lossless elbows for early construction arms such as the one in the 10hd Demonoid, but these would currently have to be very large.

The lossless elbow that has been used the most in practice is the Snark, which can be constructed directly on a single-channel construction lane using a Snarkmaker recipe. Controlled demolition of a Snark is also possible, to remove a temporary elbow that is no longer needed, and leave a hand target in its place if necessary for further construction.

A Silver reflector was used as a lossless elbow in the first spiral growth pattern, attached to a separate universal constructor component.

The LWSS possesses a tail spark which can easily perturb other objects which grow into its path. The spaceship can also perturb some objects in additional ways. For examples, see blinker ship, hivenudger, and puffer train.

Dave Buckingham found that the LWSS can be synthesized in several different ways using three gliders, and can be constructed from two gliders and another small object in several more ways. Here is the fastest synthesis:

:Lx200 A composite conduit, one of the original sixteen Herschel conduits, discovered by Paul Callahan in June 1997. It is made up of two elementary conduits, HL141B + BFx59H. The Lx200 and F166 conduits are the two original dependent conduits (several more have since been discovered.) After 200 ticks, it produces an inverted Herschel turned 90 degrees counterclockwise at (17, -40) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 90 ticks. It can be made Spartan by replacing the snakes with eater1s in one of two orientations. A ghost Herschel in the pattern below marks the output location:

	:macrocell A format used by Golly and its hashlife algorithm, capable of storing repetitive patterns very efficiently, even if they contain a large number of cells. For example, a filled square 2167 cells on a side can be stored in less than three kilobytes in macrocell format, or about 800 bytes in compressed macrocell format. The square's total population is over a googol, 10100; the number of atoms in the observable universe is only about 1080.

This high level of compression is obtained by defining a tree structure composed of increasingly large cell "tiles" with power-of-two dimensions. Tile definitions of any size are re-used whenever they appear multiple times in a large pattern (at the same power-of-two offset). For example, the following is a macrocell encoding of a complex pseudo still life arrangement of ships, with a total population over 2500 cells:

	[M2] (golly 3.0)
	#R B3/S23
	.OO.OO$O.O.O.O$OO...OO$$OO...OO$O.O.O.O$.OO.OO$
	4 0 1 1 1
	5 2 0 2 2
	6 3 3 0 3
	7 4 4 4 4
The first line after the #R rule line defines a quadtree tile at the lowest level - a level-3 tile in this case, meaning a 23 square area. At this level the pattern is encoded in a modified ASCII format with dollar signs as line separators. The next line, #2, defines a level-4 quadtree tile, made from one empty level-3 tile in the northwest corner (0), and three copies of the level-3 tile that was defined on the previous line (1). Lines 3, 4, and 5 similarly define level 5, 6, and 7 quadtree tiles by giving the line numbers of four tiles of the next lower size.

Many patterns are only moderately repetitive, so macrocell format is somewhat less successful at compressing them. Certainly most patterns are not nearly as regular as the artificial example above: there are usually many different tiles defined at each level, not just one. Chaotic patterns, such as ash from random soups, usually need so many different tile definitions that they can be stored more efficiently using rle format.

:macro-spaceship A self-constructing or self-supporting spaceship, such as the Caterpillar, Centipede, half-baked knightship, waterbear, Demonoid, Orthogonoid, and Caterloopillar. Engineered spaceships of these types tend to be much larger and more complex than elementary spaceships.

:Max A name for the smallest known spacefiller. The name represents the fact that the growth rate is the fastest possible. (This has not quite been proved, however. There remains the possibility, albeit not very likely, that a periodic agar could have an average density greater than 1/2, and a spacefiller stretching such an agar at the same speed as the known spacefillers would have a faster average growth rate.)

:mazing (p4) In terms of its minimum population of 12 this ties with mold as the smallest p4 oscillator. Found by Dave Buckingham in December 1973. For some constructions using mazings, see popover and sixty-nine.

:memory cell A type of information storage circuit useful in many patterns that perform complex logical operations. Most commonly a memory cell can store a single bit of information. See for example demultiplexer, honey bit, and boat-bit. Depending on the application, the circuit may be a toggle circuit or a permanent switch, or it may be possible to send one or more signals to set the circuit to a "1" state, as can be done with a keeper mechanism. In that case a different input signal must be used to test the current state, usually with a destructive read reaction.

A more complicated example can be found in the Osqrtlogt pattern, which destructively reads a growing 2-dimensional array of minimal memory cells. Each memory cell may either contain a boat (below left) or empty space (below right), with no permanent circuitry anywhere near:

The two beehives and the block are placed by slow salvos, after an initial 90-degree 2-glider collision that produces a target honey farm. The beehive constellation acts as a one-time turner for an incoming glider. If the boat is present, it acts as a second one-time turner for that glider, sending back a "1" signal. The "backstop" block in the northeast is destroyed cleanly in either the "0" or the "1" case.

:metacatacryst A 52-cell pattern exhibiting quadratic growth. Found by Nick Gotts, December 2000. This was for some time the smallest known pattern (in terms of initial population) with superlinear growth. See switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population superlinear growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the record-holders.

:metacell CA logic circuitry that emulates the behavior of a single cell. The circuitry is hard-wired to emulate a particular CA rule, but changing the rule is usually a matter of making simple adjustments. Known examples include David Bell's original 500×500 unit Life cell, Jared Prince's Deep Cell, Brice Due's OTCA metapixel, and Adam P. Goucher's megacell.

:metamorphosis An oscillator built by Robert Wainwright that uses the following reaction (found by Bill Gosper) to turn gliders into LWSS, and converts these LWSS back into gliders by colliding them head on using an LWSS-LWSS bounce. There are two ways to do the following reaction, because the twin bees shuttle spark is symmetric.

:mod The smallest number of generations it takes for an oscillator or spaceship to reappear in its original form, possibly subject to some rotation or reflection. The mod may be equal to the period, but it may also be a quarter of the period (for oscillators that rotate 90 degrees every quarter period) or half the period (for other oscillators which rotate 180 degrees every half period, and also for flippers).

:mold (p4) Found by Achim Flammenkamp in 1988, but not widely known until Dean Hickerson rediscovered it (and named it) in August 1989. Compare with jam. In terms of its minimum population of 12 it ties with mazing as the smallest p4 oscillator. But in terms of its 6×6 bounding box it wins outright. In fact, of all oscillators that fit in a 6×7 box it is the only one with period greater than 2.

:monochromatic salvo A slow salvo that uses gliders of only one colour. For example, the slow salvos generated by half-baked knightships are monochromatic, because they are generated by a single type of reaction which can happen at any position along a diagonal line. The smallest possible step size is one full diagonal (1fd), which is two half diagonals (2hd), which means that any single glider-producing reaction can only reach half of the available glider lanes. See colour of a glider.

:Moore neighbourhood The set of all cells that are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to a cell or group of cells. The Moore neighbourhood of a cell can be thought of as the points at a Chebyshev distance of 1 from that cell. Compare von Neumann neighbourhood. The Conway's Life rule is based on the Moore neighborhood, as are all the "Life-like" rules and many other commonly investigated rule families.

Cell neighbourhoods can also be defined with a higher range. The Moore neighbourhood of range n can be defined recursively as the Moore neighbourhood of the Moore neighbourhood of range n-1. For example, the Moore neighbourhood of range 2 includes all cells that are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the standard Moore neighbourhood.

:mosquito See mosquito1, mosquito2. mosquito3, mosquito4 and mosquito5.

:mosquito1 A breeder constructed by Nick Gotts in September 1998. The original version had an initial population of 103, which was then the smallest for any known pattern with superlinear growth (beating the record previously held by Jaws). This was reduced to 97 by Stephen Silver the following month, but was then almost immediately superseded by mosquito2.

Mosquito1 consists of the classic puffer train plus four LWSS and four MWSS (mostly in predecessor form, to keep the population down). Once it gets going it produces a new block-laying switch engine (plus a lot of junk) every 280 generations. It is therefore an MMS breeder, albeit a messy one.

:mosquito2 A breeder constructed by Nick Gotts in October 1998. Its initial population of 85 was for a couple of hours the smallest for any known pattern with superlinear growth, but was then beaten by mosquito3.

Mosquito2 is very like mosquito1, but uses two fewer MWSS and one more LWSS.

:mosquito3 A breeder constructed by Nick Gotts in October 1998. Its initial population of 75 was at the time the smallest for any known pattern with superlinear growth, but was beaten a few days later by mosquito4.

Mosquito3 has one less LWSS than mosquito2. It is somewhat different from the earlier mosquitoes in that the switch engines it makes are glider-producing rather than block-laying.

:mosquito4 A slightly improved version of mosquito3 which Stephen Silver produced in October 1998 making use of another discovery of Nick Gotts (September 1997): an 8-cell pattern that evolves into a LWSS plus some junk. Mosquito4 is a breeder with an initial population of 73, at the time the smallest for any known pattern with superlinear growth, but superseded a few days later by mosquito5.

:mosquito5 A slightly improved version of mosquito4 which Nick Gotts produced in October 1998. The improvement is of a similar nature to the improvement of mosquito4 over mosquito3. Mosquito5 is a breeder with an initial population of 71. This was the smallest population for any known pattern with superlinear growth until it was superseded by teeth. See switch-engine ping-pong for the smallest such pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the record-holders.

:mould = mold

:moving sawtooth A sawtooth such that no cell is ON for more than a finite number generations. David Bell constructed the first pattern of this type, with a c/2 front end and a c/3 back end. The front end is a blinker puffer. The back end ignites the blinker fuse.

The smallest currently known moving sawtooth was constructed in April 2011 by a conwaylife.com forum user with the handle 'cloudy197'. The c/2 front end is a bi-block puffer. The 2c/5 back end ignites the bi-block fuse.

:MWSS out of the blue The following reaction, found by Peter Rott in November 1997, in which a LWSS passing by a p46 oscillator creates a MWSS travelling in the opposite direction. Together with some reactions found by Dieter Leithner, and an LWSS-turning reaction which Rott had found in November 1993 (but which was not widely known until Paul Callahan rediscovered it in June 1994) this can be used to prove that there exist gliderless guns for LWSS, MWSS and HWSS for every period that is a multiple of 46.

:ND read = non-destructive read

:negative spaceship A type of signal travelling through a periodic agar such as zebra stripes. The leading edge of the signal removes the agar, and the trailing edge rebuilds the agar some time later. The distance between the two edges is sometimes adjustable, as shown in lightspeed bubble. The central part of the "spaceship" may consist of dying sparks or even simple empty space.

Below is a sample period-5 negative spaceship, found by Hartmut Holzwart in March 2007, in a small stabilized section of zebra stripes agar:

:non-monotonic A spaceship is said to be non-monotonic if its leading edge falls back in some generations. The first example (shown below) was found by Hartmut Holzwart in August 1992. This is p4 and travels at c/4. In April 1994, Holzwart found examples of p3 spaceships with this property, and this is clearly the smallest possible period. Another non-monotonic spaceship is the weekender.

Charles Corderman may have found this object in 1971 while exhaustively investigating the fate of all the small polyominoes. Records indicate that he found the switch engine while investigating the decominoes (polyominoes having 10 cells). However, there do not appear to be decominoes which result in a clean switch engine. If Corderman was examining polyominoes in order of size, then this smaller predecessor should have been found first in any case.

:non-spark Something that looks like a spark, but isn't. An OWSS produces one of these instead of a belly spark, and is destroyed by it.

:non-standard spaceship Any spaceship other than a glider, LWSS, MWSS or HWSS.

:non-trivial A non-trivial period-N oscillator contains at least one cell that oscillates at the full period. In other words, it is not made up solely of separate oscillators with smaller periods. Usually it includes a spark or other reaction that would not occur if all lower-period subpatterns were separated from each other, but some exceptions are given under trivial. See also omniperiodic.

:novelty generator A pattern that appears to have an unknown fate due to complex feedback loops, for example involving waves of gliders shuttling between perpendicular rakes. Novelty generator patterns fall short of counting as chaotic growth, since the rakes continue to be predictable, and much of their ash generally remains stable.

It has not been proven conclusively that any particular pattern is in fact an infinite novelty generator, since it is always possible that periodicity will spontaneously arise if the simulation is continued far enough. In fact this happens quite regularly. But conversely, it has not been proven that periodicity must spontaneously arise for all such patterns. Bill Gosper, Nick Gotts and others have done extensive experiments along these lines using Golly.

:NW31 One of the most common stable edge shooters. This Herschel-to-glider converter suppresses the junk ordinarily left behind by an evolving Herschel while allowing both the first natural glider and second natural glider to escape on transparent lanes:

:omniperiodic A cellular automaton is said to be omniperiodic if it has oscillators of all periods. It is not known if Life is omniperiodic, although this seems likely. Dave Buckingham's work on Herschel conduits in 1996 (see My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators) left only a short list of unresolved cases, all with periods of 58 or below. The list has been progressively reduced since then. Most recently, period 43 and 53 oscillators were made possible in 2013 by Mike Playle's Snark. As of June 2018, no oscillators are known for periods 19, 23, 38, or 41. If we insist that the oscillator must be non-trivial, then 34 should be added to this list.

Note that if we were to allow infinite oscillators, then all periods are certainly possible, as any period of 14 or more can be obtained using a glider (or LWSS) stream, or an infinitely long 2c/3 wire containing signals with the desired separation.

:p11 bumper (p11) A periodic colour-preserving glider reflector with a minimum repeat time of 44 ticks. Unlike the p5 through p8 cases where Noam Elkies' domino-spark based reflectors are available, no small period-22 colour-changing reflector is known. A stable Snark reflector can be substituted for any bumper. This changes the timing of the output glider, which can be useful for rephasing periodic glider streams.

In practice this reflector is not useful with input streams below period 121, because lower-period bumpers can be used to reflect all smaller multiples of 11 for which the bumper reaction can be made to work.

:p130 shuttle A shuttle found in March 2004 by David Eppstein, which originally needed several period 5 oscillators for support. David Bell found a reaction between two of the shuttles to produce a p130 glider gun. On 18 November 2017 Tanner Jacobi found that the stable sidesnagger can be used to support the shuttle instead, and this is shown here.

:p144 gun A glider gun with true period 144. The first one was found by Bill Gosper in July 1994. For a full description and pattern see factory.

:p14 gun A glider gun which emits a period 14 glider stream. This is the smallest possible period for any stream, so such a gun is of great interest. There is no known true-period p14 glider gun, and finding a small direct example is well beyond current search algorithms' abilities. However, pseudo-period p14 guns have been created by injecting gliders into a higher period glider stream. The first pseudo p14 gun was built by Dieter Leithner in 1995. Smaller pseudo p14 guns have since been constructed, but they are still much too large to show here. The essential mechanism used by them is demonstrated in GIG.

:p1 megacell (p1 circuitry) A metacell constructed by Adam P. Goucher in 2008, capable of being programmed to emulate any Moore neighborhood rule, including isotropic and anisotropic non-totalistic rules. It fits in a 32768 by 32768 bounding box, with the resulting metacell grid at 45 degrees to the underlying Life grid. Like the OTCA metapixel, it includes a large "pixel" area so that the state of the megacell can easily be seen even at extremely small-scale zoom levels.

:p1 telegraph (p1 circuitry) A variant of Jason Summers' telegraph pattern, constructed in 2010 by Adam P. Goucher using only stable circuitry. A single incoming glider produces the entire ten-part composite lightspeed signal that restores the beehive-chain lightspeed wire to its original position. The signal is detected at the other end of the telegraph and converted back into a single output signal. This simplification came at the cost of a much slower transmission speed, one bit per 91080 ticks. In this mechanism, sending the entire ten-part signal constitutes a '1' bit, and not sending the signal means '0'. See also high-bandwidth telegraph.

:p22 gun A true period 22 glider gun constructed by David Eppstein in August 2000, using two interacting copies of a p22 oscillator found earlier the same day by Jason Summers.

:p30 gun A glider gun with true period 30. The first one, found by Bill Gosper in November 1970 (see Gosper glider gun), was also the first gun found of any period. All known p30 glider guns are made from two or more interacting queen bee shuttles. Paul Callahan found 30 different ways that three queen bee shuttles can react to form a period 30 glider gun. One of the most interesting of these is shown below in which the gliders emerge in an unexpected direction.

:p44 gun A glider gun with a true period of 44. The first one was found by Dave Buckingham in April 1992. It uses two interacting copies of an oscillator which he also found. In 1996 he found a gun which only used one copy of the oscillator. Paul Callahan improved it in 1997, resulting in the gun shown below:

:p44 MWSS gun A gun discovered by Dieter Leithner in April 1997, in a somewhat larger form. This was the smallest known gliderless gun and smallest known MWSS gun until the construction in 2017 of the gun shown under gliderless, based on Tanner's p46.

The p44 MWSS gun is based on a p44 oscillator discovered by Dave Buckingham in early 1992, shown here in an improved form found in January 2005 by Jason Summers using a new p4 sparker by Nicolay Beluchenko. A glider shape appears in this gun for three consecutive generations, but always as part of a larger cluster, so even a purist would regard this gun as gliderless.

:p46 gun A glider gun which has true-period 46. The first one found was the new gun by Bill Gosper in 1971. Prior to the discovery of Tanner's p46 in October 2017, all known p46 guns were made from two or more twin bees shuttles that interact (e.g., see twin bees shuttle pair). See edge shooter and double-barrelled for two more of these.

On 21 October 2017 Heinrich Koenig found a glider gun using two copies of Tanner's p46 placed at right angles to each other. This is the first p46 gun found which makes no use of the twin bees shuttle.

:p4 bumper (p4) A periodic colour-preserving glider reflector with a minimum repeat time of 36. Unlike the p5 through p8 cases where Noam Elkies' domino spark-based reflectors are available, no small period-4 colour-changing reflector is known. A stable Snark reflector can be substituted for any bumper. This changes the timing of the output glider, which can be useful for rephasing periodic glider streams.

:p4 reflector The following glider reflector, discovered by Karel Suhajda in October 2012. Its minimum repeat time is 52 ticks. Unlike the various bouncers discovered many years earlier, it is a colour-preserving reflector, so it was made obsolete the following year by the discovery of the much smaller stable Snark, which uses the same initial bait reaction and so produces an output glider with the same timing. For a smaller periodic colour-preserving glider reflector with a different output timing, see p4 bumper.

There are several other ways to create a p60 gun from two p30 guns using period-doubling reactions similar to the one shown here.
:p690 gun A true period 690 glider gun found by Noam Elkies in July 1996. It is composed of a p30 queen bee shuttle pair and a p46 twin bees shuttle whose sparks occasionally react with each other. This is a very compact gun for such a high period and is used in many patterns requiring sparse glider streams.

For an equivalent colour-changing periodic glider reflector see p8 bouncer. A stable Snark reflector can be substituted for any bumper. This changes the timing of the output glider, which can be useful for rephasing periodic glider streams.

:p92 gun A glider gun with a true period of 92. The first one was found by Bill Gosper in 1971 using a period doubling reaction using two p46 guns. Many different p92 guns are known that use multiple twin bees shuttles. A period 92 gun can also be made by adding a semi-cenark to any period 46 glider gun.

On 18 November 2017, Martin Grant found a new gun using one twin bees shuttle and one Tanner's p46 oscillator, making it the smallest known p92 gun.

:parallel grey ship = with-the-grain grey ship

:Parallel HBK ((6,3)c/245912, p245912) A much smaller successor to the half-baked knightship, constructed by Chris Cain in September 2014. Several slow-salvo recipes are needed to support the multi-glider salvo seeds at the upstream end of the spaceship. "Parallel" means that these recipes are sent in parallel instead of one after the other, in series, as in the original HBK.

:Parallel HBK gun An armless constructor pattern that is programmed to build Parallel HBK oblique spaceships every 125906944 ticks. This gun was created by Chris Cain on 3 January 2015.

:parasite A self-sustaining reaction attached to the output of a rake or puffer, that damages or modifies the standard output. Compare tagalong. In 2009, while experimenting with novelty generator patterns in Golly, Mitchell Riley discovered parasites on glider streams from p20 and p8 backward rakes. In some cases, parasites can even "reproduce", as in the pattern below, though the number of copies is limited since they will eventually use up their host glider stream:

:parent A pattern is said to be a parent of the pattern it gives rise to after one generation. Some patterns have infinitely many parents, but others have none at all (see Garden of Eden). Typically parents are considered trivial if they contain groups of cells that can be removed without changing the result, such as isolated faraway cells.

:parent cells The three cells that cause a new cell to be born.

:parity Even or odd, particularly as applied to the phase of an oscillator or spaceship. For example, in slow salvo constructions, the intermediate targets are frequently period 2, most often because they contain blinkers or traffic lights. A glider striking a P2 constellation will generally produce a different result depending on its parity. Period-4 intermediate targets are rare (or not used), so it doesn't matter for example whether an odd-parity glider in a slow salvo is phase 1 or phase 3. Only the even/odd parity is important.

:partial result An intermediate object found by a search program which might be a substantial part of a complete spaceship or oscillator, but which isn't complete.

Running a partial result works for a few generations until the speed of light corruption from any unfinished edge destroys the whole object. But a partial result can still be used to see whether the object (if ever finished) would provide a desired spark or perturbation. If no partial results are found then it is likely that no such object exists under the constraints of the search.

Very large partial results can indicate that there is a good chance that the object being searched for might actually exist (but this is no guarantee). Rerunning the search using the partial result as a base and relaxing some constraints, widening or adjusting the search area, or splitting the object into multiple arms might result in finding a complete working object.

As an example, here is a large partial result for a period 6 knightship found by Josh Ball in April 2017. The first 22 columns were rediscovered in 2018 as part of the successful search for Sir Robin. See also almost knightship for an earlier small example by Eugene Langvagen.

:pentadecathlon (p15) Found in 1970 by Conway while tracking the history of short rows of cells, 10 cells giving this object, which is the most natural oscillator of period greater than 3. In fact it is the fifth most common oscillator overall, appearing in random soups slightly more frequently than the clock, but much less frequently than the blinker, toad, beacon or pulsar. The pentadecathlon can be constructed using just three gliders, as shown in glider synthesis.

The pentadecathlon is the only known oscillator that has two phases that are different polyominoes. It produces accessible V sparks and domino sparks, which give it a great capacity for doing perturbations, especially for period 30 based technology. See relay for example.

:pentomino Any 5-cell polyomino. There are 12 such patterns, and Conway assigned them all letters in the range O to Z, loosely based on their shapes. Only in the case of the R-pentomino has Conway's label remained in common use, but all of them can nonetheless be found in this lexicon.

:period The smallest number of generations it takes for an oscillator or spaceship to reappear in its original form. The term can also be used for a puffer, wick, fuse, superstring, stream of spaceships, factory or gun. In the last case there is a distinction between true period and pseudo period. There is also a somewhat different concept of period for wicktrailers.

:period doubler See period multiplier.

:periodic For circuit mechanisms, "periodic" is the opposite of p1 or stable. Periodic circuits necessarily contain oscillators, and therefore they can generally only accept input signals that are synchronized to the combined period of those oscillators (but see universal regulator).

For signal streams, "periodic" means that signals will only be present in the stream at one out of every n ticks, where n is the period of the stream. In a periodic intermittent stream there may be gaps, so that signals do not always appear at every nth tick. However, if a signal does appear, its distance measured in ticks from previous and future signals will always be an exact multiple of n.

:period multiplier A term commonly used for a pulse divider, because dividing the number of signals in a regular stream by N necessarily multiplies the period by N. The term "period multiplier" can be somewhat misleading in this context, because most such circuits can accept input streams that are not strictly periodic.

Reactions have also been found to period double or period triple the output of some rakes to create high-period rakes in a relatively small space (i.e., an exponential increase in period for a linear increase in size).

For Herschel signals and glider guns, a number of small period doubler, tripler, and quadrupler mechanisms are known. For example, the following conduit produces one output glider after accepting four input B-heptominoes, or four Herschels if a conduit such as F117 is prepended that includes the same BFx59H converter.

See semi-Snark and tremi-Snark for additional examples using glider streams. As of June 2018 no stable period-multiplying elementary conduits are known for a multiplication factor of five or higher, though it is easy to construct composite ones.

:permanent switch A signal-carrying circuit that can be modified so that it cleanly absorbs any future signals instead of allowing them to pass. Optionally there may be a separate mechanism to restore the circuit to its original function.

In the following example, a glider from the northeast (shown) will perform a simple block pull that switches off an F166 conduit, so that any future Herschel inputs will be cleanly absorbed. A glider from the southwest (also shown) can restore the block to its original position.

:perpendicular grey ship = against-the-grain grey ship

:perturb To change the fate of an object by reacting it with other objects. Typically, the other objects are sparks from spaceships or oscillators, or are eaters or impacting spaceships. Perturbations are typically done to turn a dirty reaction into a clean one, or to change the products of a reaction. In many desirable cases the perturbing objects are not destroyed by the reaction, or else are easily replenished.

:perturbation = perturb.

:PF35W One of the three elementary conduits used in the composite Fx176 Herschel conduit. It converts an input pi-heptomino into an output wing in 35 ticks. In November 2017, Aidan F. Pierce discovered the compact PF35W variant below, which improved the repeat time of the Fx176 to 73 ticks and allowed gliders from following dependent conduits to escape freely:

:phase A representative generation of a periodic object such as an oscillator or spaceship. The number of phases is equal to the period of the object. The phases of an object usually repeat in the same cyclic sequence forever, although some perturbations can cause a phase change.

:phase change A perturbation of a periodic object that causes the object to skip forward or backward by one or more phases. If the perturbation is repeated indefinitely, this can effectively change the period of the object. An example of this, found by Dean Hickerson in November 1998, is shown below. In this example, the period of the oscillator would be 7 if the mold were removed, but the period is increased to 8 because of the repeated phase changes caused by the mold's spark.

The following pattern demonstrates a p4 c/2 spaceship found by Jason Summers, in which the phase is changed as it deletes a forward glider. This phase change allows the spaceship to be used to delete a glider wave produced by a rake whose period is 2 (mod 4).

Phase changing reactions have enabled the construction of spaceships having periods that were otherwise unknown, and also allow the construction of period-doubling and period-tripling convoys to easily produce very high period rakes.

Every known phoenix oscillator has period 2. In January 2000, Stephen Silver showed that a period 3 oscillator cannot be a phoenix. The situation for higher periods is unknown.
An easy synthesis of the phoenix is possible using four blocks as seeds. A puffer creating a growing row of phoenixes has the unusual property that the percentage of live cells that stay alive for more than one generation approaches zero. See lone dot agar for an example of an infinite phoenix.

:pi = pi-heptomino

:Pianola breeder A series of patterns by Paul Tooke in 2010, based on a simplification and extension of the Gemini spaceship's construction mechanism. Tooke produced a number of slow-salvo-constructed patterns with superlinear growth, including a series of breeder patterns of previously unknown types. For some patterns, the Gemini's two construction arms were moved to a permanent stationary platform, using fourteen glider-loop channels instead of twelve.

Some of these breeder patterns remain difficult to classify unambiguously. For example, one pattern was designed to be an MSS breeder - a modified Gemini spaceship puffing slide guns which build lines of blocks. However, the slide guns produce both moving and stationary objects at a linear rate, because streams of gliders are needed to reach out to the construction zone to do the push reaction and build more blocks. The pattern could therefore be classified as a hybrid MSM/MSS breeder. Other breeder patterns utilizing slide guns and universal constructor technology are likely to cause similar classification ambiguities.

:pi calculator (p1 circuitry) A device constructed by Adam P. Goucher in February 2010, which calculates the decimal digits of pi (the transcendental number, not the Life pattern!) and displays them in the Life universe as 8×10 dot matrix characters formed by arrangements of blocks along a diagonal stripe at the top. A push reaction moves a ten-block diagonal cursor to the next position as part of the "printing" operation for each new digit.

The actual calculation is done in binary, using a streaming spigot algorithm based on linear fractional transformations. The pi calculator is made up of a 188-state computer connected to a printing device via period-8 regulators and a binary-to-decimal conversion mechanism. The complete pattern can be found in Golly's Very Large Patterns online archive, along with the very similar 177-state phi calculator which uses a simpler algorithm to calculate and print the Golden Ratio.

:pi climber The reaction that defines rate of travel of the Caterpillar spaceship. A pi climber consists of a pi-heptomino "climbing" a chain of blinkers, moving 17 cells every 45 ticks, and leaving behind an identical chain of blinkers, shifted downward by 6 cells. A single pi climber does not produce any gliders or other output, but two or more of them travelling on nearby blinker chains can be arranged to emit gliders every 45 ticks. Compare Herschel-pair climber.

:pixel = cell

:plet = polyplet

:polyomino A finite collection of orthogonally connected cells. The mathematical study of polyominoes was initiated by Solomon Golomb in 1953. Conway's early investigations of Life and other cellular automata involved tracking the histories of small polyominoes, this being a reasonable way to ascertain the typical behaviour of different cellular automata when the patterns had to be evolved by hand rather than by computer. Polyominoes have no special significance in Life, but their extensive study during the early years lead to a number of important discoveries and has influenced the terminology of Life. (Note on spelling: As with "dominoes" the plural may also be spelt without an e. In this lexicon I have followed Golomb in using the longer form.)

It is possible for a polyomino to be an oscillator. In fact there are infinitely many examples of such polyominoes, namely the cross and its larger analogues. The only other known examples are the block, the blinker, the toad, the star and (in two different phases) the pentadecathlon.

A polyomino can also be a spaceship, as the LWSS, MWSS and HWSS show.

:polyplet A finite collection of orthogonally or diagonally connected cells. This king-wise connectivity is a more natural concept in Life than the orthogonal connectivity of the polyomino.

:PPS (c/5 orthogonally, p30) A pre-pulsar spaceship. Any of three different p30 c/5 orthogonal spaceships in which a pre-pulsar is pushed by a pair of spiders. The back sparks of the spaceship can be used to perturb gliders in many different ways, allowing the easy construction of c/5 puffers. The first PPS was found by David Bell in May 1998 based on a p15 pre-pulsar spaceship found by Noam Elkies in December 1997. See also SPPS and APPS.

The pattern below shows the basic mechanism of a PPS. The two isolated sparks at the left and right sides are the edge sparks from the two supporting spiders.

	OOO...OOO
A pair of tubs can be placed to eat half the pre-pulsar as it replicates; this gives the p30 oscillator Eureka where the pre-pulsar's replication becomes a movement back and forth. See twirling T-tetsons II for a variation on this idea. By other means the replication of the pre-pulsar can be made to occur in just 14 generations as half of it is eaten; this allows the construction of p28 and p29 oscillators. The pre-pulsar was also a vital component of the first known p26 and p47 oscillators.

:pseudo Opposite of true. A gun emitting a period n stream of spaceships (or rakes) is said to be a pseudo period n gun if its mechanism oscillates with a period greater than n. This period will necessarily be a multiple of n. If the base mechanism's period is instead a fraction of n, then a period multiplier must also be present which is considered to be part of the mechanism, and the gun as a whole is still a true period gun. For example, a filter may be used on a lower-period gun to produce a compound gun such as the true p48 gun.

Pseudo period n glider guns are known to exist for all periods greater than or equal to 14, with smaller periods being impossible. All known p14 guns are pseudo guns requiring several signal injections, so they are quite large. The following smaller example is a pseudo period 123 gun, interleaving the streams from two true period 246 guns:

:pseudo-random glider generator A pseudo-random number generator in which the bits are represented by the presence or absence of gliders. The first pseudo-random glider generator was built by Bill Gosper. David Bell built the first moving one in 1997, using c/3 rakes.

:pseudo-random number generator A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is an algorithm that produces a sequence of bits that looks random (but cannot really be random, being algorithmically determined).

In Life, the term refers to a PRNG implemented as a Life pattern, with the bits represented by the presence or absence of objects such as gliders or blocks. Such a PRNG usually contains gliders or other spaceships in a loop with a feedback mechanism that causes later spaceships to interfere with the generation of earlier spaceships. The period can be very high, as a loop of n spaceships has 2n possible states.

:pseudo still life A stable pattern whose live cells are either immediately adjacent to each other, or are connected into a single group by adjacent dead cells where birth is suppressed by overpopulation.

The definition of strict still life rules out such stable patterns as the bi-block. In such patterns there are dead cells which have more than 3 neighbours in total, but fewer than 3 in any component still life. These patterns are called pseudo still lifes, and have been enumerated up to 32 bits, as shown in the table below.

	--------------
Attribution of these counts is given in strict still life; see also https://oeis.org/A056613. The unique 32-bit triple pseudo still life is included in the last count in the table. As the number of bits increases, the pseudo still life count goes up exponentially by approximately O(2.56n). By comparison, the rate for strict still lifes is about O(2.46n) while for quasi still lifes it's around O(3.04n).

If a stable pattern's live cells plus its overpopulated dead cells do not form a single mutually adjacent group, the pattern is usually referred to as a constellation. It is also a still life in the general sense, but is neither "pseudo" nor "strict".

:puffer An object that moves like a spaceship, except that it leaves debris behind. The first known puffers were found by Bill Gosper and travelled at c/2 orthogonally (see diagram below for the very first one, found in 1971).

Not long afterwards c/12 diagonal puffers were found (see switch engine). Discounting wickstretchers, which are not puffers in the conventional sense, no new velocity was obtained after this until David Bell found the first c/3 orthogonal puffer in April 1996. Other new puffer speeds followed over the next several years.

Many spaceships that travel orthogonally at a speed less than c/2 have useful side or back sparks. These can be used to perturb standard spaceships that approach from behind. A common technique for creating puffers for a new speed uses a convoy of the new spaceships to create debris from an approaching standard spaceship such that a new standard spaceship is recreated on the same path as the original one. This forms a closed loop, resulting in a high-period puffer for the new speed.

As of June 2018, puffers have been found matching every known velocity of elementary spaceship, except for c/6 and c/7 diagonal and (2,1)c/6. It is also generally easy to create puffers based on macro-spaceships, simply by removing some part of the trailing cleanup mechanism.

:puffer engine A pattern which can be used as the main component of a puffer. The pattern may itself be a puffer (e.g. the classic puffer train), it may be a spaceship (e.g. the Schick engine), or it may even be unstable (e.g. the switch engine).

:pufferfish (c/2, p12) A puffer discovered by Richard Schank in November 2014, from a symmetric soup search using an early version of apgsearch. It consists of a pair of B-heptominoes stabilised by a backend that leaves only pairs of blocks behind. It is simple enough to be easily synthesized with gliders.

May refer specifically to the extensible c/2 spaceship constructed by Ivan Fomichev in December 2014, the first such spaceship to contain no period-2 or period-4 parts. (The first two or three rows might be considered to be period 2 or 4, but they are directly dependent on following rows for support.).

The pattern consists of two adjacent pufferfish puffers, plus four copies of a nontrivial period 36 c/2 fuse for pufferfish exhaust, discovered using a randomized soup search.

:puff suppressor An attachment at the back of a line puffer that suppresses all or some of its puffing action. The example below (by Hartmut Holzwart) has a 3-cell puff suppressor at the back which suppresses the entire puff, making a p2 spaceship. If you delete this puff suppressor then you get a p60 double beehive puffer. Puff suppressors were first recognised by Alan Hensel in April 1994.

:pulse A moving object, such as a spaceship or Herschel, which can be used to transmit information. See pulse divider.

Also another name for a pulsar quadrant.

:pulse divider A mechanism that lets every n-th object that reaches it pass through, and deletes all the rest, where n > 1 and the objects are typically gliders, spaceships or Herschels. A common synonym is period multiplier. For n=2, the simplest known stable pulse dividers are the semi-Snarks.

The following diagram shows a p5 glider pulse divider by Dieter Leithner (February 1998). The first glider moves the centre block and is reflected at 90 degrees. The next glider to come along will not be reflected, but will move the block back to its original position. The relatively small size and low period of this example made it useful for constructing compact glider guns of certain periods, but it became largely obsolete with the discovery of the stable CC semi-Snark, which uses the same basic mechanism. Period 7, 22, 36 and 46 versions of this pulse divider are also known.

As a consequence of the Four-Colour Theorem, there can be no analogous objects requiring decomposition into five or more pieces. By convention, patterns like this and the triple pseudo are considered to be pseudo still lifes, not strict still lifes. As of June 2018, it has been shown that no quad pseudo patterns exist with 32 or fewer bits, but a 33-bit pattern with this property may theoretically still be found.

:quadratic filter A toolkit developed by Dean Hickerson and Gabriel Nivasch in 2006, enabling the construction of patterns with asymptotic population growth matching an infinite number of different sublinear functions - namely, O(t(1/2n)) for any chosen n. See also exponential filter, recursive filter.

:quadratic growth The fastest possible asymptotic rate of population growth for any Life pattern - O(t2) in big-O notation, where t is the number of ticks. The first quadratic-growth pattern found was Bill Gosper's 1971 breeder. Many other types of breeders and spacefillers have been constructed since.

In April 2011, Stephen Silver gave an example of a one-cell-thick pattern over a million cells long that exhibited quadratic growth. In October 2015, Chris Cain constructed a one-cell-thick pattern with a reduced bounding box of 2596×1, improving on a series of previous longer results. The smallest known quadratic growth pattern by initial population is the 23-cell switch-engine ping-pong by Michael Simkin.

There are an infinite number of possible growth rates between linear and quadratic growth. See superlinear growth.

:quadratic replicator A pattern that fills all or part of the Life plane by making copies of itself in a nonlinear way. Small quadratic replicators are known in other Life-like rules, but as of July 2018 no example has been found or constructed in Conway's Life.

:quadratic sawtooth Any sawtooth pattern with a quadratic envelope, or specifically a pattern assembled by Martin Grant in May 2015, consisting of two caber tossers with period multipliers for timing which activate and deactivate two toggleable rake guns (see toggleable gun). The gliders emitted by those rakes annihilate on the diagonal while the rakes are eaten by 2c/5 ships. All the rakes and gliders are destroyed before the next cycle. See also Osqrtlogt.

:quadri-Snark A period-multiplying colour-preserving signal conduit found by Tanner Jacobi in October 2017, producing one output glider for every four input gliders. It is made by replacing one of the eaters in a tremi-Snark with a catalyst found using Bellman. The catalyst causes the formation of a tub which then requires an additional glider to delete. However, this adds 5 ticks to the repeat time, so that it becomes 48. If period quadrupling is needed with a colour-changing reaction, a CP semi-Snark and a CC semi-Snark can be used in series, or a period-multiplying Herschel conduit can be connected to a syringe and an appropriately chosen Herschel-to-glider converter.

:quarter diagonal A unit of measurement sometimes used for diagonal distances, especially for slow salvo glider lanes. One advantage of measurement in quarter diagonals is that gliders travel diagonally at 1qd/tick, so that the same integer value can serve as either a time or a diagonal distance measurement.

:quasi still life A stable constellation where the individual still lifes share dead cells, so the neighborhoods of those dead cells are changed, but all cells that used to remain dead from under-population still do so. Under Life rules, this occurs when objects are diagonally adjacent (e.g., two blocks sharing a single diagonal neighbor) or when single protruding cells in two objects such as tubs share multiple neighbors. The term is due to Mark Niemiec.

As the number of bits increases, the quasi still life count goes up exponentially by approximately O(3.04n), slightly more than a factor of three. By comparison, the rate for strict still lifes is about O(2.46n) while for pseudo still lifes it's around O(2.56n).

:queen bee See queen bee shuttle.

:queen bee shuttle (p30) Found by Bill Gosper in 1970. There are a number of ways to stabilize the ends. Gosper originally stabilized shuttles against one another in a square of eight shuttles. Two simpler methods are shown here; for a third see buckaroo. The queen bee shuttle is the basis of all known true p30 guns (see Gosper glider gun).

:queen bee shuttle pair Any arrangement of two queen bee shuttles such that the two beehives created between them are consumed in some way. There are many ways that the two shuttles can be placed, either head-to-head, or else at right angles. The most well-known and useful arrangement results in the Gosper glider gun.

Other arrangements don't create any lasting output, but create large sparks which can perturb objects (especially gliders) in various ways. For example, one arrangement of a queen bee shuttle pair was used in the original unit Life cell as a memory cell. Here an input glider is converted into a block, which remains until it is deleted by a glider on a right-angled path.

After 64 ticks, it produces a Herschel rotated 90 degrees clockwise at (11, 9) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 153 ticks, though this can be improved to 61 ticks by adding a from-the-side eater inside the turn to avoid interference from the output Herschel's first natural glider, as shown below.

:racetrack A pattern in which a signal makes its way in a loop through an "obstacle course" of reactions in order to demonstrate various ways that the signal can be reflected, temporarily stored, and converted. The more different reactions that are used the better the racetrack. David Goodenough built racetracks for p30 and p46 technology in 1995. Racetracks are also known for Herschel conduit technology, and simple ones are useful for building oscillators and glider guns.

:rake Any puffer whose debris consists of spaceships. A rake is said to be forwards, backwards or sideways according to the direction of the spaceships relative to the direction of the rake. Originally the term "rake" was applied only to forwards c/2 glider puffers (see space rake). Many people prefer not to use the term in the case where the puffed spaceships travel parallel or anti-parallel to the puffer, as in this case they do not rake out any significant region of the Life plane (and, in contrast to true rakes, these puffers cannot travel in a stream, and so could never be produced by a gun).

Although the first rakes (circa 1971) were c/2, rakes of other velocities have since been built. Dean Hickerson's construction of Corderships in 1991 made it easy for c/12 diagonal rakes to be built, although no one actually did this until 1998, by which time David Bell had constructed c/3 and c/5 rakes (May 1996 and September 1997, respectively). Jason Summers constructed a 2c/5 rake in June 2000 (building on work by Paul Tooke and David Bell) and a c/4 orthogonal rake in October 2000 (based largely on reactions found by David Bell).

The smallest possible period for a rake is probably 7, as this could be achieved by a 3c/7 orthogonal backwards glider puffer. The smallest period attained to date is 8 (Jason Summers' backrake, March 2001).

:R-bee = bun. This name is due to the fact that the pattern is a single-cell modification of a beehive.

:reaction envelope The collection of cells that are alive during some part of a given active reaction. This term is used for Herschel circuits and other stable circuitry, whereas construction envelope is specific to recipes in self-constructing circuitry.

There are some subtleties at the edges of the envelope. Specifically, two reactions that have the exact same set of cells defining their envelopes may have different behavior when placed next to a single-cell protrusion like the tail of an eater1, or one side of a tub. The difference depends on whether two orthogonally adjacent cells at the edge of the envelope are ever simultaneously alive, within the protruding cell's zone of influence.

:reanimation A reaction performed by a convoy of spaceships (or other moving objects) which converts a common stationary object into a glider without harming the convoy. This provides one way for signals that have been frozen in place by some previous reaction to be released for use.

Simple reactions using period 4 c/2 spaceships have been found for reanimating a block, boat, beehive, ship, loaf, bi-block, or toad. The most interesting of these is for a beehive since it seems to require an unusual p4 spaceship:

Reanimation of a loaf is used many times in the Caterloopillar. It is also used in the Caterpillar as part of its catch and throw mechanism. Finally, reanimation can produce rakes from some puffers. See stop and restart for a similar idea that applies to Herschel conduits and other signal circuitry.

There are small objects which have no known reanimation reactions using c/2 ships other than the brute force method of hitting them with the output of rakes.

:reburnable fuse A very rare type of fuse whose output is identical to its input, possibly with some spatial and/or temporal offset. See lightspeed wire for an example. Reburnable fuses are used primarily in the construction of fixed-speed self-supporting macro-spaceships, where the speed of the fuse's burning reaction becomes the speed of the spaceship. Examples include the Caterpillar, Centipede, and waterbear.

:receiver See Herschel receiver.

:recipe = glider synthesis or construction recipe.

:recovery time The number of ticks that must elapse after a signal is sent through a conduit, before another signal can be safely sent on the same path. In general, a lower recovery time means a more useful conduit. For example, the Snark's very low recovery time allowed for the creation of oscillators with previously unknown periods, 43 and 53.

For the most part this is a synonym for repeat time. However, overclocking a complex circuit can often allow it to be used at a repeat time much lower than its safe recovery time.

:rectifier The smallest known 180-degree reflector, discovered by Adam P. Goucher in 2009. It was the smallest and fastest stable reflector of any kind until the discovery of the Snark in 2013. The rectifier has the same output glider as the boojum reflector but a much shorter repeat time of only 106 ticks.

Another advantage of the rectifier is that the output glider is on a transparent lane, so it can be used in logic circuitry to merge two signal paths.

:recursive filter A toolkit developed by Alexey Nigin in July 2015, which enables the construction of patterns with population growth that asymptotically matches an infinite number of different superlinear functions. Toolkits enabling other, sublinear infinite series had been completed by Dean Hickerson and Gabriel Nivasch in 2006. See quadratic filter and exponential filter.

Sublinear functions are possible using the recursive-filter toolkit as well. It can be used to construct a glider-emitting pattern with a slowness rate S(t) = O(log***...*(t)), the nth-level iterated logarithm of t, which asymptotically dominates any primitive-recursive function f(t).

:reflector Any stable or oscillating pattern that can reflect some type of spaceship (usually a glider) without suffering permanent damage. A pattern that is damaged or destroyed during the reflection process is generally called a one-time turner instead.

The first known reflector was the pentadecathlon, which functions as a 180-degree glider reflector (see relay). Other examples include the buckaroo, the twin bees shuttle and some oscillators based on the traffic jam reaction. Glider guns can also be made into reflectors, although these are mostly rather large.

In September 1998 Noam Elkies found some fast small-period glider reflectors, with oscillators supplying the required domino sparks at different periods. A figure-8 produced a p8 bouncer, and a p6 pipsquirter produced an equivalent p6 bouncer. A more complicated construction allows a p5 bouncer (which, as had been anticipated, soon led to a true p55 Quetzal gun). And in August 1999 Elkies found a suitable sparker to produce a p7 bouncer, allowing the first p49 oscillator to be constructed.

These were all called simply "p5 reflector", "p6 reflector", etc., until 6 April 2016 when Tanner Jacobi discovered an equally small and simple reaction, the bumper, starting with a loaf as bait instead of a boat. This resulted in a series of periodic colour-preserving reflectors, whereas Elkies' bouncer reflectors are all colour-changing. A useful mnemonic is that "bouncer" contains a C and is colour-changing, whereas "bumper" contains a P and is colour-preserving.

Stable reflectors are special in that if they satisfy certain conditions they can be used to construct oscillators of all sufficiently large periods. It was known for some time that stable reflectors were possible (see universal constructor), but no one was able to construct an explicit example until Paul Callahan did so in October 1996.

Callahan's original reflector has a repeat time of 4840, soon improved to 1686, then 894, and then 850. In November 1996 Dean Hickerson found a variant in which this is reduced to 747. Dave Buckingham reduced it to 672 in May 1997 using a somewhat different method, and in October 1997 Stephen Silver reduced it to 623 by a method closer to the original. In November 1998 Callahan reduced this to 575 with a new initial reaction. A small modification by Silver a few days later brought this down to 497.

In April 2001 Dave Greene found a 180-degree stable reflector with a repeat time of only 202 (see boojum reflector). This reflector won bounties offered by Dieter Leithner and Alan Hensel. Half of the prize money was recycled into a new prize for a small 90-degree reflector, which in turn was won by Mike Playle's colour-preserving Snark reflector. The Snark is currently the smallest known stable reflector, with a recovery time of 43. Playle has offered a $100 prize for a colour-changing stable reflector contained within a 25 by 25 bounding box, with a recovery time of 50 generations or less.

As of June 2018, the following splitter is among the smallest known 90-degree colour-changing reflectors. The top output can be blocked off by an eater if needed. For small 180-degree colour-changing reflectors see rectifier, and also the sample pattern in splitter.

:reflectorless rotating oscillator A pattern that rotates itself 90 or 180 degrees after some number of generations, with the additional constraint that multiple non-interacting copies of the pattern can be combined into a new oscillator with a period equal to the appropriate fraction of the component oscillators' period. The second constraint disqualifies small time-symmetric oscillators such as the blinker and monogram.

A working RRO might look something like a pi orbital or p256 gun loop containing one or more pis or Herschels in the same loop, but without any external stabilisation mechanism. Such patterns can be proven to exist (see universal constructor), but as of June 2018 none have been explicitly constructed in Life. There is no upper limit on multiplicity for a constructor-based RRO.

:regulator An object which converts input gliders aligned to some period to output gliders aligned to a different period. The most interesting case is a universal regulator, of which several have been constructed by Paul Chapman and others.

:relay Any oscillator in which spaceships (typically gliders) travel in a loop. The simplest example is the p60 one shown below using two pentadecathlons. Pulling the pentadecathlons further apart allows any period of the form 60+120n to be achieved. This is the simplest proof of the existence of oscillators of arbitrarily large period.

:repeater Any oscillator or spaceship.

:repeat time The minimum number of generations that is possible between the arrival of one object and the arrival of the next. This term is used for things such as reflectors or conduits where the signal objects (gliders or Herschels, for example) will interact fatally with each other if they are too close together, or one will interact fatally with a disturbance caused by the other. For example, the repeat time of Dave Buckingham's 59-step B-heptomino to Herschel conduit (shown under conduit) is 58.

:rephaser The following reaction that shifts the phase and path of a pair of gliders. There is another form of this reaction, glider-block cycle, that reflects the gliders 180 degrees.

:replicator A finite pattern which repeatedly creates copies of itself. Such objects are known to exist (see universal constructor), but no concrete example is known. The linear propagator may be considered to be the first example of a replicator built in Life, but this is debatable as each of its copies replicates itself only once, allowing no possibility of superlinear growth.

:reverse caber tosser A storage mechanism for data feeding a universal constructor designed by Adam P. Goucher in 2018. A very large integer can be encoded in the position of a very faraway object. If the distance to that object is measured using circuitry designed to be as simple as possible, a complete decoder and universal constructor can be created by colliding a small number of gliders - no more than 329 according to a June 2018 glider synthesis, and exactly 43 according to a July 1 redesign by Chris Cain using eight far-distant GPSEs and, amazingly, no stationary circuitry except for a single catalyst block. Some intermediate designs with 50+ gliders need no stationary circuitry at all.

With the correct placement of the faraway object, the complete pattern is theoretically capable of building any glider-constructible object. This means that 43 is the maximum number of gliders required to build any constructible object, no matter what size. However, it is not possible to determine in practice what the locations of these 43 gliders should be, even for a relatively simple construction.

:RF28B A converter with several known forms, many of which found by Dave Buckingham in 1972 and in the early 1980s. It accepts an R-pentomino as input and produces an output B-heptomino 28 ticks later. Of nine major variants known as of July 2018, four versions are shown below. For each version, the R-pentomino inputs are shown near the left and right edges, along with the B-heptomino output locations near the center.

:rle Run-length encoded. Run-length encoding is a simple (but not very efficient) method of file compression. In Life the term refers to a specific ASCII encoding used for patterns in Conway's Life and other similar cellular automata. This encoding was introduced by Dave Buckingham and is now the usual means of exchanging relatively small patterns by email or in online forum discussions.

As an example of the rle format, here is a representation of the Gosper glider gun. The "run lengths" are the numbers, b's are dead cells, o's are live cells, and dollar signs signal new lines:

	x = 36, y = 9, rule = B3/S23
	24bo$22bobo$12boo6boo12boo$11bo3bo4boo12boo$oo8bo
	5bo3boo$oo8bo3boboo4bobo$10bo5bo7bo$11bo3bo$12boo!
Over the years RLE format has been extended to handle patterns with multiple states, neighborhoods, rules, and universe sizes. A completely different encoding, macrocell format, is used for repetitive patterns that may have very large populations.

:R-mango A small active reaction, so named because it is a single-cell modification of a mango, but now more commonly known as dove.

This converter has several common uses. It can be attached to the L156 Herschel conduit to change it into a useful period doubler. Connecting it to the initial stage of the L156 produces a composite Herschel-to-glider converter often used as a splitter, or as a quasi-edge shooter after suppressing the additional glider output:

The above H-to-2G mechanism appears in many places in the glider gun collection, for example, mainly for periods below 78 where syringes can't be used to build small true-period guns. The insertion reaction allows a glider to be placed 19 ticks in front of another glider on the same lane, or 30 ticks behind it (28 if the perpendicular glider output is suppressed.)
:rock Dean Hickerson's term for an eater which remains intact throughout the eating process. The snake in Dave Buckingham's 59-step B-to-Herschel conduit (shown under conduit) is an example. Other still lifes that sometimes act as rocks include the tub, the hook with tail, the eater1 (eating with its tail) and the hat (in Heinrich Koenig's stabilization of the twin bees shuttle).

:rotor The cells of an oscillator that change state. Compare stator. It is easy to see that any rotor cell must be adjacent to another rotor cell.

:R-pentomino This is by far the most active polyomino with less than six cells: all the others stabilize in at most 10 generations, but the R-pentomino does not do so until generation 1103, by which time it has a population of 116, including six gliders.

At generation 774, an R-pentomino produces a queen bee which lasts 17 more generations before being destroyed, enough time for it to flip over. This observation led to the discovery of the Gosper glider gun.
:RRO = reflectorless rotating oscillator

:rule 22 Wolfram's rule 22 is the 2-state 1-D cellular automaton in which a cell is ON in the next generation if and only if exactly one of its three neighbours is ON in the current generation (a cell being counted as a neighbour of itself). This is the behaviour of Life on a cylinder of width 1.

:salvo A collection of spaceships, usually gliders, all travelling in the same direction. Any valid glider construction recipe can be partitioned into no more than four salvos. Compare flotilla. In contrast with a convoy, the spaceships in a salvo are usually consumed by the reactions that they cause. Simple examples include block pusher and block pull.

Salvos may be slow or synchronized. The following partially synchronized three-glider salvo produces an LWSS from a block.

The above is a synchronized salvo and not a slow salvo, because the second glider must follow the first with the exact separation shown. The third glider can be considered to be a slow glider, because it will still delete the temporary loaf no matter how many ticks it is delayed. The slow glider construction entry includes an example of a true slow salvo.
:sawtooth Any finite pattern whose population grows without bound but does not tend to infinity. (In other words, the population reaches new heights infinitely often, but also infinitely often returns to some fixed value.) Conway's preferred plural is "sawteeth".

The first sawtooth was constructed by Dean Hickerson in April 1991. The current smallest known sawtooth was found by a conwaylife.com forum user with the online handle 'thunk'. It has a bounding box of 74×60, and is the smallest known sawtooth in terms of its minimum repeating population of 177 cells. The following variant has a higher repeating population of 194 and an optimized bounding box of 62×56:

:Schick engine (c/2 orthogonally, p12) This spaceship, found by Paul Schick in 1972, produces a large spark (the 15 live cells at the rear in the phase shown below) which can be perturbed by other c/2 spaceships to form a variety of puffers. See blinker ship for an example perturbation of the spark. The diagram below shows the smallest form of the Schick engine, using two LWSS. It is also possible to use two MWSSes or two HWSSes, or even an LWSS and an HWSS.

:search program A computer program or script that automates the search for Life objects having certain desired properties. These are used because the difficulty of finding previously unknown Life objects now commonly exceeds the patience, speed, and accuracy of humans. Various types of search programs are used for finding objects such as spaceships, oscillators, drifters, catalysts, soups, Gardens of Eden, and slow salvos.

Some search programs generate partial results as they are running, so even if they don't complete successfully, something of use might still be salvaged from the run.

Example search programs are dr, lifesrc, gfind, and Bellman.

There are other types of programs which don't perform searches as such, but instead perform large constructions. These are used to correctly complete very complicated objects such as the Caterpillar, Gemini, Caterloopillar, and universal constructor-based spaceships such as the Demonoids and Orthogonoids.

:second glider domain The second glider domain of an edge shooter is the set of spacetime offsets, relative to the glider stream emitted by the edge shooter, where a second independent glider stream may be present without interfering with the edge shooter. This is useful to know, because edge shooters are often used to generate glider streams very close to other glider streams, to make for example a spaceship gun or converter.

:second natural glider The glider produced at T=72 during the evolution of a Herschel. This is the common edge-shooting glider output used in the NW31 converter and several other converter variants.

:seed A constellation of still lifes and/or oscillators, which can be converted into another Life object when it is struck by one or more gliders. Usually the resulting object is a rare still life or spaceship, more complex than the original constellation. Spartan single-glider (1G) seeds are more commonly seen than multi-glider seeds, because a Spartan 1G seed can be readily constructed and triggered using a slow salvo. See also freeze-dried. For example, the following is a 14sL 1G seed for a c/7 loafer spaceship.

:Seeds of Destruction Game An interactive search application written by Paul Chapman in 2013. Its primary purpose was to assist in the design of self-destruct circuits in self-constructing circuitry. It has also regularly been helpful in completing glider syntheses, and was used to find the 31c/240 base reaction for the shield bug and Centipede spaceships.

:self-constructing A type of pattern, generally a macro-spaceship, that contains encoded construction information about itself, and makes a complete copy of itself using those instructions. The Gemini, linear propagator, spiral growth patterns, Demonoids and Orthogonoid are examples of self-constructing patterns. Self-constructing spaceships often have trivially adjustable speeds. In many cases, the direction of travel can also be altered, less easily, by changing the encoded construction recipe. Compare self-supporting, elementary.

:self-supporting A type of pattern, specifically a macro-spaceship, that constructs signals or tracks or other scaffolding to assist its movement, but does not contain complete information about its own structure. Examples include the Caterpillar, Centipede, half-baked knightship, waterbear, and the Caterloopillars. Caterpillar has been used as a general term for self-supporting spaceships, but it is not very appropriate for the HBKs.

In general a self-supporting pattern cannot be trivially adjusted to alter its speed or direction. The variable speeds of the HBKs and the Caterloopillars are exceptions, but their direction of travel is fixed, and a specific Caterloopillar can't be made to change its speed without completely rebuilding it. Compare self-constructing, elementary.

:semi-cenark Either of two semi-Snark variants discovered by Tanner Jacobi in November 2017. The name is due to the initial converter, which produces a century output for every two input gliders. The minimum safe repeat time is 43 ticks for the smaller initial catalyst shown in CC semi-cenark and CP semi-cenark, or 42 ticks with the slightly larger catalyst variant shown below. There is also overclocking possible at period 36, 38, or 39. The reset glider can be followed immediately by a new trigger glider, as shown below, so the minimum repeat time for an intermittent stream of gliders is only 50 ticks.

:semi-Snark Any small stable signal conduit that produces one output glider for every two input gliders, with a 90 degree reflection. These can act as period-doublers for any glider stream whose period is at least equal to their repeat time, and so adding one of these to a single glider gun often results in a pattern much smaller than the older technology of crossing the output of two guns.

The available semi-Snarks differ in their complexity, size, repeat time, and the colour of their output gliders. The CC semi-Snark was the first one found, and the term "semi-Snark" is often used specifically for this object. The "CC" prefix stands for colour-changing, by contrast with the more recently discovered colour-preserving CP semi-Snark.

There are also CC and CP variants of a semi-Snark based on a two-glider to century converter discovered by Tanner Jacobi in November 2017. These semi-cenarks are the fastest semi-Snarks known as of July 2018, with a repeat time as low as 50 ticks, or a periodic input rate as low as 36 ticks.

:signal Movement of information through the Life universe. Signals can be carried by spaceships, fuses, drifters, or conduits. Spaceships can only transfer a signal at the speed of the spaceship, while fuses can transfer a signal at speeds up to the speed of light.

In practice, many signals are encoded as the presence or absence of a glider or other spaceship at a particular point at a particular time. Such signals can be combined by the collision of gliders to form logic operations such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. Signals can be duplicated using glider duplicators or other fanout devices, and can be used up by causing perturbations on other parts of the Life object.

Signals are used in Herschel conduit circuitry, universal constructors, macro-spaceships, and other computational patterns such as the pi calculator and Osqrtlogt patterns.

:signal elbow A conduit with signal output 90 degrees from its input. This term is commonly used only for signal wires, particularly 2c/3 signals. A Snark could reasonably be called a "glider elbow", but glider reflector is the standard term. A signal elbow with a recovery time less than 20 ticks would enable a trivial proof that Conway's Life is omniperiodic.

A near miss is the following elbow-like converter found by Dean Hickerson. It successfully turns a 2c/3 signal by 90 degrees, but unfortunately changes it to a double-length signal in the process. This means that further copies of the converter can not be appended (e.g., to make a closed loop).

Relatively small composite MWSS elbows can now be constructed, using Tanner Jacobi's 2015 discovery of a small H-to-MWSS component. For example, the Orthogonoid includes a constructor/reflector that reflects an MWSS stream by 180 degrees, but it can be trivially reconfigured to make a 90-degree MWSS elbow.

:Silver G-to-H A variant of the Silver reflector made by substituting an Fx119 conduit for the final NW31, allowing a Herschel output as well as the beehive-annihilating reset glider. It is still Spartan, and as long as the Fx119 is followed by a dependent conduit, it retains the faster 497-tick recovery time.

:Silver reflector A stable glider reflector found by Stephen Silver in November 1998, by substituting an NW31 converter for the second Fx77 conduit in the Callahan G-to-H found a few days previous. The repeat time is 497 ticks:

In terms of its 36-cell minimum population, it is one of the smallest known guns, sharing the record with the Gosper glider gun. In the double-barreled form, as well as the pseudo-period, snake-stabilized form shown below, it is the absolute record holder.

:single-arm A type of universal constructor using just one construction arm and slow salvo techniques to construct, usually, Spartan or near-Spartan circuitry. Compare two-arm.

:single-channel A type of universal constructor discovered and developed by Simon Ekström and others starting in December 2015. The initial elbow operation toolkit was near-minimal, with just one push, one pull, and one output glider of each colour (see colour of a glider). Later searches produced a much larger and more efficient library.

Single-channel recipes consist of a stream of gliders on a single lane and aimed at a construction elbow, usually separated from each other by at least 90 ticks. In spite of these strict limitations, single-channel recipes can be made to do surprising things. For example, it is possible to build a Snark directly on the construction lane of an active construction arm, starting from a single elbow block. This can allow the arm to reach efficiently around complex obstructions by bending itself through multiple lossless elbows. Known recipes can also remove an elbow when it is no longer needed, by controlled demolition of the Snark.

As of June 2018, almost all single-channel recipes are made up of singletons and synchronized pairs of gliders, but no synchronized triplets or larger groups. This is not an inherent limitation of single-channel construction, but rather a limitation in the search program used to find currently known single-channel toolkits.

A useful byproduct of this limitation is that single-channel recipes can be trivially adjusted to allow them to safely cross perpendicular data streams, including other single-channel recipes (or earlier parts of the same recipe). To avoid collisions with a crossing stream, each singleton glider or glider pair can safely be delayed by any even number of ticks, or technically by any multiple of the period of the current intermediate target. The final result of the construction will not be affected.

:single-channel Demonoid See Demonoid.

:single-lane = single-channel.

:singleton In single-channel recipes, a glider that is not synchronized with a neighboring glider in its stream. Compare glider pair.

:sL Abbreviation for still life, used most often in rough measurements of the complexity of a Spartan constellation.

:slide gun A gun which fires sideways from an extending arm. The arm consists of streams of spaceships which are pushing a pattern away from the body of the gun and releasing an output spaceship every time they do so. Each output spaceship therefore travels along a different path.

Dieter Leithner constructed the first slide gun in July 1994 (although he used the term "side shooting gun"). The following pattern shows the key reaction of this slide gun. The three gliders shown will push the block one cell diagonally, thereby extending the length of the arm by one cell, and at the same time they release an output glider sideways. (In 1999, Jason Summers constructed slide guns using other reactions.)

:sliding block memory A memory register whose value is stored as the position of a block. The block can be moved by means of glider collisions. See block pusher for an example.

In Conway's original formulation (as part of his proof of the existence of a universal computer in Life) two gliders were used to pull the block inwards by three diagonal spaces, as shown below, and thirty gliders were used to push it out by the same amount.

Dean Hickerson later greatly improved on this, finding a way to pull a block inwards by one diagonal space using 2 gliders, and push it out the same distance using 3 gliders. In order for the memory to be of any use there also has to be a way to read the value held. It suffices to be able to check whether the value is zero (as Conway did), or to be able to detect the transition from one to zero (as Hickerson did).

Dean Hickerson's sliding block memory is used in Paul Chapman's URM, and the key salvos from it are used in several other complex constructions, such as David Bell's Collatz 5N+1 simulator and Adam P. Goucher's pi calculator and Spartan universal computer-constructor.

:slmake A search program published by Adam P. Goucher in May 2017. It accepts as input a constellation of sufficiently widely separated still lifes, and produces a glider stream that will perform a complete slow glider construction of that constellation, starting from a single block.

One of slmake's primary uses is to make self-constructing patterns much easier to design and build. It is capable of finding recipes not only for Spartan stable circuitry, but also for other useful non-Spartan circuits such as Snarks, syringes, and H-to-MWSS converters, provided that they are separated from other nearby objects by a sufficient amount of empty space.

:slow See slow glider construction.

:slow elbow A movable construction elbow that is controlled by a slow salvo, which most likely comes from a previous elbow in a multi-elbow construction arm. Unlike a standard elbow which is generally fixed on a single construction lane or at least within a narrow range, a slow elbow can move freely in two dimensions as long as there is room for it. Each slow elbow added to a construction arm results in an exponential increase in the cost (in gliders) of the final construction. Compare lossless elbow.

:slow glider construction Construction an object by a "slow salvo" of gliders all coming from the same direction, in such a way that timing of the gliders does not matter as long as they are not too close behind one another. This type of construction requires an initial seed object, such as a block, which is modified by each glider in turn until the desired object is produced.

In May 1997, Nick Gotts produced a slow glider construction of a block-laying switch engine from a block, using a slow salvo of 53 gliders. Constructions like this are important in the study of sparse Life, as they will occur naturally as gliders created in the first few generations collide with blonks and other debris.

Slow glider constructions are also useful in some designs for universal constructors. However, in this case the above definition is usually too restrictive, and it is desirable to allow constructions in which some gliders in the salvo are required to have a particular timing modulo 2 (a "p2 slow salvo"). This gives much greater flexibility, as blinkers can now be freely used in the intermediate construction steps. The Snarkmaker is a very large p2 slow salvo. A much smaller example is the following edgy construction of an eater1 starting from a block.

:smoke Debris that is fairly long-lived but eventually dies completely. Basically, a large spark. This term is used especially when talking about the output from a smoking ship. Some Herschel conduits such as Fx119 also create large amounts of smoke.

:smoking ship A spaceship which produces smoke. If the smoke extends past the edge of the rest of the spaceship, then it can be used to perturb other objects as the spaceship passes by. Running gliders into the smoke is often a good way to turn or duplicate them, or convert them into other objects. Sometimes the smoke from a smoking ship may itself be perturbed by accompanying spaceships in order to form a puffer. A simple example of a smoking ship is the Schick engine.

:snacker (p9) Found by Mark Niemiec in 1972. This is a pentadecathlon with stabilizers which force it into a lower period.

The stabilizers make the domino spark largely inaccessible, but the snacker is extensible, as shown in the next diagram, and so a more accessible p9 domino spark can be obtained. In April 1998 Dean Hickerson found an alternative stabilizer that is less obtrusive than the original one, and this is also shown in this diagram.

:snake bit An alternative name for a boat-bit. Not a very sensible name, because various other things can be used instead of a snake. A snake, or alternatively an aircraft carrier, is the smallest object that can consume a glider stream by effectively acting as an eater for every two incoming gliders. The one-cell reduction from the smallest real eater, the seven-cell eater1, has been important when trying to construct recent sawtooths where the population must be minimized.

:Snarkmaker A single-channel stream of gliders that, when aimed to collide with an elbow block in a specific location, will perform a slow glider construction of a Snark, directly on the same lane as the incoming gliders. This allows a construction arm to add one or more lossless elbows, so that it can bend around multiple corners without an exponential increase in construction cost.

The Snarkmaker recipe used in the first single-channel Demonoid, Orthogonoid, and spiral growth patterns contains 2,254 gliders. This could be considerably reduced with a customized search program.

:SNG = second natural glider.

:SODGame = Seeds of Destruction Game

:sombrero One half of sombreros or siesta.

:sombreros (p6) Found by Dave Buckingham in 1972. If the two halves are moved three spaces closer to one another then the period drops to 4, and the result is just a less compact form of Achim's p4. Compare also siesta.

:soup A random initial pattern, either contained within a small area, or alternatively filling the whole Life universe.

Finite soups probably have behaviors very different than infinite soups, but this is obviously unknown. Infinite soups may remain chaotic indefinitely since any reaction, no matter how rare, is bound to happen somewhere.

Soups can have an average density, with results varying based on that. See sparse Life for a discussion of what can happen at a low density.

Finite soups for sizes such as 16×16 (asymmetric) have been examined by the billions by scripts such as apgsearch to find interesting results. Many new oscillators and synthesis recipes have been discovered, as well as previously known rare patterns such as stabilized switch engines. In addition, soups are used to generate statistical census data, and to decide whether specific objects can be considered natural.

Soups can be fully random, or they can be forced to be symmetric. The results for these two types of soups can differ since symmetric soups tend to create large symmetrical objects at a much higher rate. Shown below is an unusual mirror-symmetric soup that produces a pufferfish and nothing else.

:space dust A part of a spaceship or oscillator which looks like a random mix of ON and OFF cells. It is usually very difficult to find a glider synthesis for an object that consists wholly or partly of space dust. As examples, the 295P5H1V1, fly, and seal spaceships contain large amounts of space dust.

:spacefiller Any pattern that grows at a quadratic rate by filling space with an agar. The first example was found in September 1993 by Hartmut Holzwart, following a suggestion by Alan Hensel. The diagram below shows a smaller spacefiller found by Tim Coe. See also Max. Spacefillers can be considered as breeders (more precisely, MMS breeders), but they are very different from ordinary breeders. The word "spacefiller" was suggested by Harold McIntosh and soon became the accepted term.

:spaceship Any finite pattern that reappears (without additions or losses) after a number of generations and displaced by a non-zero amount. By far the most natural spaceships are the glider, LWSS, MWSS and HWSS, followed by the Coe ship which has also evolved multiple times from random asymmetric soup starting conditions. See also the entries on individual spaceship speeds: c/2 spaceship, c/3 spaceship, c/4 spaceship, c/5 spaceship, c/6 spaceship, c/7 spaceship, c/10 spaceship, c/12 spaceship, 2c/5 spaceship, 2c/7 spaceship, 3c/7 spaceship, (2,1)c/6 spaceship, and 17c/45 spaceship.

It is known that there exist spaceships travelling in all rational directions and at arbitrarily slow speeds (see universal constructor). Before 1989, however, the only known examples travelled at c/4 diagonally (gliders) or c/2 orthogonally (everything else).

In 1989 Dean Hickerson started to use automated searches to look for new elementary spaceships, and had considerable success. Other people have continued these searches using tools such as lifesrc and gfind, and as a result we now have a great variety of elementary spaceships travelling at sixteen different velocities. The following table details the discovery of elementary spaceships with new velocities as of July 2018.

Several infinite families of adjustable-velocity macro-spaceships have also been constructed, of which the first was Gabriel Nivasch's Caterpillar from December 2004. The macro-spaceship with the widest range of possible speeds is Michael Simkin's Caterloopillar from April 2016; in theory it supports any rational orthogonal speed strictly less than c<4. A somewhat similar design supporting any rational speed strictly less than c/2 has been shown to be feasible, but as of July 2018 no explicit examples have been constructed.

A period p spaceship that displaces itself (m,n) during its period, where m>=n, is said to be of type (m,n)/p. It was proved by Conway in 1970 that p>=2m+2n. (This follows immediately from the easily-proved fact that a pattern cannot advance diagonally at a rate greater than one half diagonal step every other generation.)

:Spaceships in Conway's Life A series of articles posted by David Bell to the newsgroup comp.theory.cell-automata during the period August-October 1992 that described many of the new spaceships found by himself, Dean Hickerson and Hartmut Holzwart. Bell produced an addendum covering more recent developments in 1996.

:spaghetti monster The first 3c/7 spaceship, found by Tim Coe in June 2016. The spaceship travels orthogonally, has a minimum of 702 live cells and fits in a 27×137 bounding box.

:spark A pattern that dies. The term is typically used to describe a collection of cells periodically thrown off by an oscillator or spaceship, but other dying patterns, particularly those consisting or only one or two cells (such as produced by certain glider collisions, for example), are also described as sparks. For examples of small sparks see unix and HWSS. Examples of much larger sparks are seen in Schick engine and twin bees shuttle spark.

:spark coil (p2) Found in 1971.

:sparker An oscillator or spaceship that produces sparks. These can be used to perturb other patterns without being themselves affected.

:sparking eater One of two eaters found in April 1997 and November 1998 by Dean Hickerson using his dr search program, shown below to the left and right respectively. These both absorb gliders as a standard eater does, but also produce separated single-bit sparks at the upper right, which can be used to delete antiparallel gliders with different phases as shown.

	.....................O..............
The above mechanisms can be used to build intermitting glider guns. The left-hand eater produces a spark nine ticks after a glider impact, with the result that the period of the constituent guns can't be a multiple of 4. The right-hand eater produces the same spark ten ticks after impact, which allows p4N guns to be used.
The separation of the spark also allows this reaction to perform other perturbations "around the corner" of some objects. For example, it was used by Jason Summers in 2004 to cap the ends of a row of ten AK47 reactions to form a much smaller period 94 glider gun than the original one. (This is now made obsolete by the AK94 gun.)

:sparse Life This refers to the study of the evolution of a Life universe which starts off as a random soup of extremely low density. Such a universe is dominated at an early stage by blocks and blinkers (often referred to collectively as blonks) in a ratio of about 2:1. Much later it will be dominated by simple infinite growth patterns (presumably mostly switch engines). The long-term fate of a sparse Life universe is less certain. It may possibly become dominated by self-reproducing patterns (see universal constructor), but it is not at all clear that there is any mechanism for these to deal with all the junk produced by switch engines.

:Spartan A pattern composed of subunits that can be easily constructed in any orientation, usually with a slow salvo. Generally this means that the pattern is a constellation of Spartan still lifes: block, tub, boat, hive, ship, loaf, eater1, or pond. Other small objects may sometimes be counted as Spartan, including period-2 oscillators - mainly blinkers, but also beacons or toads, which may occur as intermediate targets in slow salvo recipes. Most self-constructing patterns are Spartan or mostly Spartan, to simplify the process of self-construction.

:speed booster Any mechanism which allows a signal (indicated by the presence or absence of a spaceship) to move faster than the spaceship could travel through empty space. The original speed booster is based on p30 technology, and is shown below:

Here the top glider is boosted by passing through two inline inverters, emerging 5 cells further along than the unboosted glider at the left.
The fastest speed boosters are the telegraph and p1 telegraph, which can transfer a orthogonal signal at the speed of light, although their bit rate is rather slow.

Diagonal speed boosters have also been built using 2c/3 wires or other stable components. See stable pseudo-Heisenburp.

The star gate seems like it can transfer a signal faster than the speed of light. The illusion is explained in Fast Forward Force Field.

:speed of light The greatest speed at which any effect can propagate; in Life, a speed of one cell per generation. Usually denoted c.

:spiral growth A self-constructing pattern built by Dave Greene in August 2014 that uses four universal constructors (UCs) arranged in a diamond to build four more UCs in a slightly larger diamond. This was the first B3/S23 pattern that exhibited spiral growth. Much smaller versions have now been constructed using the single-channel construction toolkit.

:splitter A signal converter that accepts a single input signal and produces two or more output signals, usually of the same type as the input. An older term for this is fanout, or "fanout device".

A sub-category is the one-time splitter, which is not technically a converter because it can only be used once. One-time splitters are usually small constellations that produce two or more clean gliders when struck by a single glider. In other words, they are multi-glider seeds. These are important for constructing self-destruct circuitry in self-constructing spaceships.

The following combination, a syringe attached to an SE7T14 converter combined with an NW31 converter, is one of the smallest known glider splitters as of July 2018. Another small splitter with a 90-degree colour-changing output is shown under reflector.

:stabilized switch engine A single switch engine which survives indefinitely by interacting with the appropriate exhaust such that it prevents the engine from ever being destroyed.

The only known types of stabilized switch engines were found by Charles Corderman soon after he discovered the switch engine itself. There is a p288 block-laying type (the more common of the two) and the p384 glider-producing type. These two puffers are the most natural infinite growth patterns in Life. As of June 2018 they are the basis for every infinite growth pattern ever seen to occur from a random asymmetric soup, even after trillions of census results by apgsearch and similar projects.

Patterns giving rise to block-laying switch engines can be seen under infinite growth, and one giving rise to a glider-producing switch engine is shown under time bomb.

Here is the block-laying type showing its distinctive zig-zag trail of blocks.

:stable A pattern is said to be stable if it is a parent of itself. Stable objects are oscillators with period 1 (p1), and are generally called still lifes.

:stable pseudo-Heisenburp A multi-stage converter constructed by Dave Greene in January 2007, using a complex recipe found by Noam Elkies to insert a signal into a 2c/3 wire. The wire's high transmission speed allows a signal from a highway robber to catch up to a salvo of gliders. Ultimately the mechanism restores the key glider, which was destroyed by the highway robber in the first stage of the converter, to its exact original position in the salvo.

Much smaller stable pseudo-Heisenburp devices have since been designed that use simple 0-degree glider seed constellations instead of a 2c/3 wire.

These patterns are labeled "pseudo-Heisenburp", because a true Heisenburp device does not even temporarily damage or affect a passing glider, yet can still produce an output signal in response. However, it is impossible to construct a stable device that can accomplish this for gliders. True stable Heisenburp devices are possible with many other types of spaceships, but not with gliders which have no usable side sparks to initiate an output signal.

:staged recovery A type of signal-processing circuit where the initial reaction between catalysts an incoming signal results in an imperfect recovery. A catalyst is damaged, destroyed completely as in a bait reaction, or one or more objects are left behind that must be cleaned up before the circuit can be reused. In any of these three cases, output signals from the circuit must be used to complete the cleanup. In theory the cleanup process might itself be dirty, requiring additional cleanup stages. In rare cases this might theoretically allow the construction of special-purpose circuits with a lower recovery time than would otherwise be possible, but in practice this kind of situation does not commonly arise.

An example is the record-breaking (at the time) 487-tick reflector constructed by Adam P. Goucher on 12 April 2009. 487 ticks was a slight improvement over the repeat time of the Silver reflector. The reflector featured a standard Callahan G-to-H, with cleanup by an internal dirty glider reflector found by Dieter Leithner many years before. This in turn was cleaned up by the usual ungainly Herschel plumbing attached to the G-to-H's output. The dirty glider reflector is not actually fully recovered before a second p487 signal enters the full reflector. However, it has been repaired by the time the internal reflector is actually needed again, so the cycle can be successfully repeated at p487 instead of p497.

:stamp collection A collection of oscillators (or perhaps other Life objects) in a single diagram, displaying the exhibits much like stamps in a stamp album. The classic examples are by Dean Hickerson (see http://conwaylife.com/ref/DRH/stamps.html).

Many stamp collections contain "fonts" made of single cells (which cleanly die) to annotate the objects or to draw boxes around them. For example, here is a stamp collection which shows all the ways that two gliders can create a loaf or an eater:

	.O......O.O.....O....O.O.O...................O.

Alternatively, stamp collections can use LifeHistory for their annotations, but this requires a more sophisticated Life program to handle. Numbers, or more rarely letters, are sometimes constructed from stable components such as blocks or snakes, but their readability is somewhat limited by placement constraints.

:star gate A device by Dieter Leithner (October 1996) for transporting a LWSS faster than the speed of light. The key reaction is the Fast Forward Force Field.

:stator The cells of an oscillator that are always on. Compare rotor. (The stator is sometimes taken to include also some of those cells which are always off.) The stator is divided into the bushing and the casing.

By analogy, the cells of an eater that remain on even when the eater is eating are considered to constitute the stator of the eater. This is not always well-defined, because an eater can have more than one eating action.

:statorless A statorless oscillator is one in which no cell is permanently on - that is, the stator is empty, or in other words the oscillator has the maximum possible volatility. See the volatility entry for examples of this type of oscillator at different periods. Statorless oscillators can be constructed for any sufficiently large period, using universal constructor technology.

:statorless p5 (p5) Found by Josh Ball, June 2016. The first and only known statorless period 5 oscillator.

:still life Any stable pattern, usually assumed to be finite and nonempty. For the purposes of enumerating still lifes this definition is, however, unsatisfactory because, for example, any pair of blocks would count as a still life, and there would therefore be an infinite number of 8-bit still lifes.

For this reason a stricter definition is often used, counting a stable pattern as a strict still life only if its islands cannot be divided into two or more nonempty sets both of which are stable in their own right. If such a subdivision can be made, the pattern can be referred to as a constellation. If its cells form a single cluster it is also, more specifically, either a pseudo still life or a quasi still life.

In rare cases above a certain size threshold, a pattern may be divisible into three or four stable nonempty subsets but not into two. See the 32-bit triple pseudo (32 bits) and the 34-bit quad pseudo for examples.

All still lifes up to 18 bits have been shown to be glider constructible. It is an open question whether all still lifes can be incrementally constructed using glider collisions. For a subset of small still lifes that have been found to be especially useful in self-constructing circuitry, see also Spartan.

The smallest still life is the block. Arbitrarily large still lifes are easy to construct, for example by extending a canoe or barge. The maximum density of a large still life is 1/2, which can be achieved by an arbitrarily large patch of zebra stripes or chicken wire, among many other options. See density for more precise limits.

:stop and restart A type of signal circuit where an input signal is converted into a stationary object, which is then re-activated by a secondary input signal. This can be used either as a memory device storing one bit of information, or as a simple delay mechanism. In the following January 2016 example by Martin Grant, a ghost Herschel marks the output signal location, and a "ghost beehive" marks the location of the intermediate still life.

The eater1 in the lower left corner catches the restart glider if no input signal has come in to create the beehive. This eater could be removed if it is useful to have both a "0" and a "1" output for a memory cell mechanism.
The catch and throw technology in a Caterpillar is a somewhat similar idea. See also stop and go and reanimation.

:stream A line of identical objects (usually spaceships), each of which is moving in a direction parallel to the line, generally on the same lane. In many uses the stream is periodic. For example, the new gun produces a period 46 glider stream. The stream produced by a pseudo-random glider generator can have a very high period. Compare with wave. See also single-channel for a common use of non-periodic glider streams.

:stretcher Any pattern that grows by stretching a wick or agar. See wickstretcher and spacefiller.

:strict still life A still life that is either a single connected polyplet, or is arranged such that a stable smaller pattern cannot be formed by removing one or more of its islands. For example, beehive with tail is a strict still life because it is connected, and table on table is a strict still life because neither of the tables are stable by themselves. See also triple pseudo, quad pseudo.

Still lifes have been enumerated by Conway (4-7 bits), Robert Wainwright (8-10 bits), Dave Buckingham (11-13 bits), Peter Raynham (14 bits), Mark Niemiec (15-24 bits), and Simon Ekström and Nathaniel Johnston (25-32 bits). The resulting figures are shown below; see also https://oeis.org/A019473. The most recent search by Nathaniel Johnston has also confirmed that the triple pseudo pattern found by Gabriel Nivasch is the only such still life with 32 bits or less. It is therefore included in the pseudo still life count and not in the table below.

As the number of bits increases, the strict still life count goes up exponentially by approximately O(2.46n). By comparison, the rate for pseudo still life}s is about O(2.56n) while for quasi still lifes it's around O(3.04n).

:strict volatility A term suggested by Noam Elkies in August 1998 for the proportion of cells involved in a period n oscillator which themselves oscillate with period n. For prime n this is the same as the ordinary volatility. Periods with known strictly-volatile oscillators include 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 15, 22, 30, 33, and 177. Examples include figure-8, Kok's galaxy, smiley, and pentadecathlon. A composite example is the following p22, found by Nicolay Beluchenko on 4 March 2009:

The first superfountain was found by Noam Elkies in February 1998. In January 2006 Nicolay Beluchenko found the much smaller one shown below. See also fountain.

:superlinear growth Growth faster than any rate proportional to T, where T is the number of ticks that a pattern has been run. This term usually applies to a pattern's population growth, rather than diametric growth or bounding-box growth. For example, breeders' and spacefillers' population asymptotically grows faster than any linear-growth pattern. It may also be used to describe the rate of increase in the number of subpatterns present in a pattern, such as when describing a replicator's rate of reproduction. Due to limits enforced by the speed of light, no pattern's population can grow at an asymptotic rate faster than quadratic growth. See switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population superlinear growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the record-holders.

:superstring An infinite orthogonal row of cells stabilized on one side so that it moves at the speed of light, often leaving debris behind. The first examples were found in 1971 by Edward Fitzgerald and Robert Wainwright. Superstrings were studied extensively by Peter Rott during 1992-1994, and he found examples with many different periods. (But no odd periods. In August 1998 Stephen Silver proved that odd-period superstrings are impossible.)

Sometimes a finite section of a superstring can be made to run between two tracks ("waveguides"). This gives a fuse which can be made as wide as desired. The first example was found by Tony Smithurst and uses tubs. (This is shown below. The superstring itself is p4 with a repeating section of width 9 producing one blinker per period and was one of those discovered in 1971. With the track in place, however, the period is 8. This track can also be used with a number of other superstrings.) Shortly after seeing this example, in March 1997 Peter Rott found another superstring track consisting of boats. At present these are the only two waveguides known. Both are destroyed by the superstring as it moves along. It would be interesting to find one that remains intact.

See titanic toroidal traveler for another example of a superstring.

:support Those parts of an object which are only present in order to keep the rest of the object (such an engine or an edge spark) working correctly. These can be components of the object, or else accompanying objects used to perturb the object. In many cases there is a wide variation of support possible for an engine. The arms in many puffers are an example of support.

Besides the southwest-travelling glider on lane 1, the converter also emits the Herschel's standard first natural glider, SW-2. The converter's full standard name is therefore "HSW1T43_SW-2T21". See NW31 for an explanation of H-to-G naming conventions.
:SW-2 The simplest type of H-to-G converter, where the converter's effect is simply to suppress a Herschel cleanly after allowing its first natural glider to escape. The name should be read as "SW minus two", where -2 is a glider lane number. The complete designation is SW-2T21. See NW31T120 for a discussion of the standard naming conventions used for these converters.

An unlimited number of converters have the SW-2T21 classification. The variants most often used consist of just one or two small still life catalysts.

:switch A signal-carrying circuit that can send output signals to two or more different locations, depending on the state of the mechanism. These may be toggle circuits, where the state of the switch changes after each use, or permanent switches that retain the same state through many uses until a change is made with a separate signal.

More generally, any circuit may be referred to as a switch, if it can alter its output based on stored information. For example, the following simple mechanism based on an eater2 was discovered by Emerson J. Perkins in 2007. It either reflects or absorbs an incoming signal, depending on the presence or absence of a nearby block. The block is removed if a reflection occurs.

The switching signal here is a glider produced by a high-clearance syringe variant found by Matthias Merzenich. The syringe is not technically part of the switch mechanism; any standard Herschel source can deliver the signal to the block factory (the two eater1s on the right side of the pattern). Alternate converter mechanisms could also be used to place the block.

An earlier example of the same type of one-time switch mechanism, also mediated by a block, can be found in the NW34T204 H-to-G. See also bistable switch for a very robust and versatile toggle switch with two input lanes and four possible outputs.

:switchable gun A gun that includes a mechanism to turn the output stream off and on with simple signals, often gliders. A small example is Dieter Leithner's switchable LWSS gun from July 8, 1995. The ON signal enters from the northeast, and the OFF signal from the northwest:

:switch engine The following pattern discovered by Charles Corderman in 1971, which is a glide symmetric unstable puffer which moves diagonally at a speed of c/12 (8 cells every 96 generations).

	.O.O..
	O.....
	.O..O.
	...OOO
The exhaust is dirty and unfortunately catches up and destroys the switch engine before it runs 13 full periods. Corderman found several ways to stabilize the switch engine to produce puffers, using either one or two switch engines in tandem. See stabilized switch engine and ark.

No spaceships were able to be made from switch engines until Dean Hickerson found the first one in April 1991 (see Cordership). Switch engine technology is now well-advanced, producing many c/12 diagonal spaceships, puffers, and rakes of many periods.

Small polyominoes exist whose evolution results in a switch engine. See nonomino switch engine predecessor.

Several three-glider collisions produce dirty reactions that produce a stabilized switch engine along with other ash, making infinite growth. Until recently the only known syntheses for clean unstabilized switch engines used four or more gliders. There are several such recipes. In the reaction shown below no glider arrives from the direction that the switch engine will travel to, making it easier to repeat the reaction:

Running the above for 20 ticks completes a kickback reaction with the top two gliders, resulting in the three-glider switch engine recipe discovered by Luka Okanishi on 12 March 2017.

:switch-engine ping-pong A very large (210515×183739) quadratic growth pattern found by Michael Simkin in October 2014. Currently this is the smallest starting population (23 cells) known to result in a quadratic population growth rate. Previous record-holders include Jaws, mosquito1, mosquito2, mosquito3, mosquito4, mosquito5, teeth, catacryst, metacatacryst, Gotts dots, wedge, 26-cell quadratic growth, 25-cell quadratic growth, and 24-cell quadratic growth.

:symmetric Any object which can be rotated and/or flipped over an axis and still maintain the same shape. Many common small objects such as the block, beehive, pond, loaf, clock, and blinker are symmetric. Some larger symmetric objects are Kok's galaxy, Achim's p16, cross, Eureka, and the pulsar.

Large symmetric objects can easily be created by placing multiple copies of any finite object together in a symmetrical way. Unless the individual objects interact significantly, this is considered trivial and is not considered further here (e.g., two LWSSs travelling together a hundred cells apart).

There are two kinds of symmetry. Odd symmetry occurs when an object's line of reflection passes through the center of a line of cells. Objects with odd symmetry have an odd number of columns or rows, and can have a gutter. Even symmetry occurs when the line of reflection follows the boundary between two lines of cells. Objects with even symmetry have an even number of columns or rows.

Because the Life universe and its rules are symmetric, all symmetric objects must remain symmetric throughout their evolution. Most non-symmetric objects keep their non-symmetry as they evolve, but some can become symmetric, especially if they result in a single object. Here is a slightly more complicated example where two gliders interact to form a blockade:

	..O.........
	O.O.........
	.OO........O
	.........OO.
	..........OO
Many useful objects are symmetric along an orthogonal axis. This commonly occurs by placing two copies of an object side by side to change the behaviour of the objects due to the inhibition or killing of new cells at their gutter interface. Examples of this are twin bees shuttle, centinal, and the object shown in puffer. Other useful symmetric objects are created by perturbing a symmetric object using nearby oscillators or spaceships in a symmetric manner. Examples of this are Schick engine, blinker ship, and hivenudger.

Many spaceships found by search programs are symmetric because the search space for such objects is much smaller than for non-symmetrical spaceships. Examples include dart, 60P5H2V0, and 119P4H1V0.

:synchronized Indicates that precise relative timing is required for two or more input signals entering a circuit, or two or more sets of gliders participating in a glider synthesis. Compare asynchronous. See also salvo and slow glider construction.

:synchronous = synchronized

:synthesis = glider synthesis

:syringe A small stable converter found by Tanner Jacobi in March 2015, accepting a glider as input and producing an output Herschel As of June 2018 it is the smallest known converter of this type, so it is very often used to handle input gliders in complex signal circuitry, as described in Herschel circuit. A second glider can safely follow the first any time after 78 ticks, but overclocking also allows the syringe to work at a repeat time of 74 or 75 ticks. If followed by a dependent conduit a simple eater2 can be used instead of the large welded catalyst shown here. A ghost Herschel marks the output location.

:tagalong An object which is not a spaceship in its own right, but which can be attached to one or more spaceships to form a larger spaceship. For examples see Canada goose, fly, pushalong, sidecar and sparky. See also Schick engine, which consists of a tagalong attached to two LWSS (or similar).

The following c/4 spaceship (Nicolay Beluchenko, February 2004) has two wings, either of which can be considered as a tagalong. But if either wing is removed, then the remaining wing becomes an essential component of the spaceship, and so is no longer a tagalong.

The snakes can be replaced with eaters to form a slightly smaller version, as shown in the p46 MWSS gun in gliderless
The period of this new oscillator is the same as the old twin bees shuttle, and so this is able to expand the known p46 technology. For example, a p46 glider gun can be made from a Tanner's p46 and just one of the twin bees shuttles.

Acting on their own, two copies of Tanner's p46 placed at right angles to each other with their sparks interacting can produce two different p46 glider guns and a gliderless p46 MWSS gun. See p46 gun and gliderless for two of these. These are the first p46 guns found which do not use a twin bees shuttle at all.

:target A necessary component of a slow salvo recipe used by a single-arm universal constructor. A target usually consists of a single object, or sometimes a small constellation of common still lifes and/or oscillators. See intermediate target. If no hand target is available, a construction arm may be unable to construct anything, unless recipes are available to generate targets directly from the elbow.

:technology The collective set of known reactions exploiting one subset of the Life universe. Examples of these subsets include glider synthesis, period 30 glider streams, c/3 spaceships, sparkers, Herschel conduits, and slow salvos. As new reactions and objects are found, over time any particular technology becomes more versatile and complete. Many Life experts like to concentrate on particular technologies.

:tee A head-on collision between three gliders, producing a perpendicular output glider that can be used to construct closely spaced glider salvos, or to inject a glider into an existing stream. There are several workable recipes. One of the more useful is the following, because the tandem glider can be generated by a small Herschel converter, SW1T43:

:teeth A 65-cell quadratic growth pattern found by Nick Gotts in March 2000. This (and a related 65-cell pattern which Gotts found at about the same time) beat the record previously held by mosquito5 for smallest population known to have superlinear growth, but was later superseded by catacryst. See switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population superlinear growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the record-holders.

:telegraph A pattern created by Jason Summers in February 2003. It transmits and receives information using a rare type of reburnable fuse, a lightspeed wire made from a chain of beehives, at the rate of 1440 ticks per bit. The rate of travel of signals through the entire transceiver device can be increased to any speed strictly less than the speed of light by increasing the length of the beehive chain appropriately.

"Telegraph" may also refer to any device that sends and receives lightspeed signals; see also p1 telegraph, high-bandwidth telegraph.

:ternary reaction Any reaction between three objects. In particular, a reaction in which two gliders from one stream and one glider from a crossing stream of the same period annihilate each other. This can be used to combine two glider guns of the same period to produce a new glider gun with double the period.

The protruding cells at the edges can perturb some reactions by encouraging and then suppressing births on successive ticks. For example, a toad can replace the northwest eater in the Callahan G-to-H converter, allowing it to be packed one diagonal cell closer to other circuits.

:toad-flipper A toad hassler that works in the manner of the following example. Two domino sparkers, here pentadecathlons, apply their sparks to the toad in order to flip it over. When the sparks are applied again it is flipped back. Either or both domino sparkers can be moved down two spaces from the position shown and the toad-flipper will still work, but because of symmetry there are really only two different types. Compare toad-sucker.

:toggleable gun Any gun that can be turned off or turned on by the same external signal - the simplest possible switching mechanism. An input signal causes the gun to stop producing gliders. Another input signal from the same source restores the gun to its original function. Compare switchable gun.

In the figure above, glider B and an LWSS are about to send a glider NW. Glider A will delete the next glider after B, turning off the output stream. But if the device were already off, B wouldn't be present and A would instead delete the leading LWSS, turning the device back on.
:toggle circuit Any signal-processing circuit that switches back and forth between two possible states or outputs. An early example is the boat-bit. More recent discoveries include the semi-Snarks, which alternate between reflecting and absorbing input gliders. The following B-to-G converter sends alternate glider outputs in opposite directions.

:TOLLCASS Acronym for The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search.

:toolkit A set of Life reactions and mechanisms that can be used to solve any problem in a specific pre-defined class of problems: glider timing adjustment, salvo creation, seed construction, etc. See also universal toolkit, technology.

:torus As applies to Life, usually means a finite Life universe which takes the form of an m × n rectangle with the bottom edge considered to be joined to the top edge and the left edge joined to the right edge, so that the universe is topologically a torus. There are also other less obvious ways of obtaining a toroidal universe.

See also Klein bottle. Every object in a torus universe obviously either dies or becomes a still life or oscillator.

:total aperiodic Any finite pattern which evolves in such a way that no cell in the Life plane is eventually periodic. The first example was found by Bill Gosper in November 1997. A few days later he found the following much smaller example consisting of three copies of a p12 backrake by Dave Buckingham.

:track A path made out of conduits, often ending where it begins so that the active signal object is cycled forever, forming an oscillator or a gun.

This term has also been used to refer to the lane on which a glider or spaceship travels. The concept is very similar, but a reference to a "track" now usually implies a non-trivial supporting conduit.

The following illustrates the reaction used, in which a newly created traffic light at the left eventually pushes the rightmost one slightly to the right.

:transparent In signal circuitry, a term used for a catalyst that is completely destroyed by the passing signal, then rebuilt. Often (though not always) the active reaction passes directly through the area occupied by the transparent catalyst, then rebuilds the catalyst behind itself, as in the transparent block reaction. See also transparent lane.

:transparent block reaction A certain reaction between a block and a Herschel predecessor in which the block reappears in its original place some time later, the reaction having effectively passed through it. This reaction was found by Dave Buckingham in 1988. It has been used in some Herschel conduits, and in the gunstars. Because the reaction involves a Herschel predecessor rather than an actual Herschel, the following diagram shows instead a B-heptomino (which by itself would evolve into a block and a Herschel).

	O.............

:transparent debris effect A mechanism where a Herschel or other active reaction completely destroys a catalyst in a particular location in a conduit. After passing through or past that location, the same reaction then recreates the catalyst in exactly its original position. This type of catalysis is surprisingly common in signal circuitry. For an example, see transparent block reaction.

The transparent object is most often a very common still life such as a block or beehive. Rarer objects are not unknown; for example, a transparent loaf was found by Stephen Silver in October 1997, in a very useful elementary conduit making up part of a Herschel receiver. However, not surprisingly, rarer objects are much less likely to reappear in exactly the correct location and orientation, so transparent reactions involving them are much more difficult to find, on average.

:transparent lane A path through a signal-producing circuit that can be used to merge signal streams. The signal is usually a standard spaceship such as a glider. It can either be produced by the circuit, or it can come from elsewhere, passing safely through on the same lane without interacting with the circuit. A good example is the NW31 converter, which has two glider outputs on transparent lanes:

The optional third output shown in NW31 is non-transparent, because the upper eater1 catalyst would get in the way of a passing glider on the same lane.

:tremi-Snark A colour-preserving period-multiplying signal conduit found by Tanner Jacobi on 7 September 2017, producing one output glider for every three input gliders. It uses the same block-to-pre-honeyfarm bait reaction as the Snark, and so has the same 43-tick recovery time. Compare semi-Snark.

:tubstretcher Any wickstretcher in which the wick is two diagonal lines of cells forming, successively, a tub, a barge, a long barge, etc. The first one was found by Hartmut Holzwart in June 1993, although at the time this was considered to be a boatstretcher (as it was shown with an extra cell, making the tub into a boat). The following small example is by Nicolay Beluchenko (August 2005), using a quarter.

:tumbler The smallest known p14 oscillator. Found by George Collins in 1970. The oscillator generates domino sparks, but they are fragile and no use has been found for them to date. In each domino, one cell is "held" (remains alive) for two generations, the other for three. By contrast, useful domino sparks are usually alive for only one tick per oscillator period.

:turner A one-time glider reflector, or in other words a single-glider seed (the term is seldom or never used in relation to spaceships other than gliders). One-time turners may be 90-degree or 180-degree, or they may be 0-degree with the output in the same direction as the input. A reusable turner would instead be called a reflector. Shown on the top row below are the four 90-degree turner reactions that use common small ash objects: boat, eater1, long boat, and toad.

:turtle A spaceship found by Dean Hickerson in August 1989 that produces a domino spark at the back. Hickerson used this spark to convert an approaching HWSS into a loaf, as part of the first sawtooth. (Also see tractor beam). The shape of the back end of the turtle is distinctive. Very similar but wider back ends have been found in other c/3 ships to produce period 9 and 15 spaceships.

:twin-bees-shuttle Found by Bill Gosper in 1971, this was the basis of all known true p46 guns, and all known p46 oscillators except for glider signal loops using Snarks, until the discovery of Tanner's p46 in 2017. See new gun for an example. There are numerous ways to stabilize the ends, two of which are shown in the diagram. On the left is David Bell's double block reaction (which results in a shorter, but wider, shuttle than usual), and on the right is the stabilization by a single block. This latter method produces the very large twin bees shuttle spark which is useful in a number of ways. See metamorphosis for an example. Adding a symmetrically placed block below this one suppresses the spark. See also p54 shuttle.

:volatility The volatility of an oscillator is the size (in cells) of its rotor divided by the sum of the sizes of its rotor and its stator. In other words, it is the proportion of cells involved in the oscillator which actually oscillate. For many periods there are known oscillators with volatility 1, see for example Achim's p16, figure-8, Kok's galaxy, mazing, pentadecathlon, phoenix, relay, smiley and tumbler. Such an oscillator of period 3 was found in August 2012 by Jason Summers.

:worker bee (p9) Found by Dave Buckingham in 1972. Unlike the similar snacker this produces no sparks, and so is not very important. Like the snacker, the worker bee is extensible. It is, in fact, a finite version of the infinite oscillator which consists of six ON cells and two OFF cells alternating along a line. Note that Dean Hickerson's new snacker ends also work here.

:x66 (c/2 orthogonally, p4) Found by Hartmut Holzwart, July 1992. Half of this can be escorted by an HWSS. The name refers to the fact that every cell (live or dead) has at most 6 live neighbours (in contrast to spaceships based on LWSS, MWSS or HWSS). In fact this spaceship was found by a search with this restriction.

:zebra stripes (p1) A stable agar consisting of alternating bands of live and dead cells. Known spacefillers and many gray ships create patches of this agar. It is also the medium through which with the grain and against the grain negative spaceships travel. Many simple stabilizations of the boundaries of finite regions of this agar are known, as shown below.

:zone of influence The set of cells on which a chosen cell or pattern can potentially exert an influence in a given number of generations N. If N is not specified it is generally taken to be one, in which case the zone of influence simply coincides with the Moore neighbourhood of the cell or pattern. The set for N generations consists of all the cells to which at least N paths of length N can be traced from the cell(s) in question. Contrast this with the range-N Moore neighbourhood, which consists of all cells to which at least one path of length n can be traced.
